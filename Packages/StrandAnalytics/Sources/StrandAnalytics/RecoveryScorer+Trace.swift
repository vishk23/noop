// RecoveryScorer+Trace.swift - the Charge TERM-BREAKDOWN diagnostic (Recovery test mode).
//
// Recomputes the four-plus-one weighted Charge terms from the SAME inputs RecoveryScorer.recovery
// reads, then reuses recovery(...) verbatim for the final score so the trace can never disagree with
// the number the dashboard shows. Pure and side-effect-free: no clock, no I/O, so a fixture night
// pins the exact lines. The Recovery test mode gates this behind TestCentre.active(.recovery) at the
// call site (IntelligenceEngine recomputeRecovery); when the mode is off it is never called, so there
// is zero cost. No em-dashes. Counts, z-scores and weights only, no PII.

# Privacy & Security

This document describes NOOP's privacy posture, security model, and the hardening
applied to the parts of the codebase that touch untrusted input. It is written
against the actual source tree; file paths and identifiers below are real and can
be checked.

## 1. Design principle: offline by default

NOOP is **offline by default**. The biometric pipeline — strap → on-device decode →
local SQLite — has no network layer at all: no phone-home, no analytics, no accounts,
no login, no cloud sync, and no telemetry. Everything NOOP computes about you lives in a
single SQLite file on your own device.

There are exactly **two** opt-in exceptions: the **AI Coach** (§1.1a) and the **Oura history
import** (§1.1b). The AI Coach is off until you turn it on with your own API key; when you
ask it a question it sends a short text summary of your recent metrics to the provider you
choose. The Oura history import is **not even compiled into a default build** — the code
only exists in your binary if you build from source with your own Oura developer app's
credentials (§1.1b); instead of sending data out, it pulls your own Oura data **in** over
OAuth, once, and never sends any of your existing NOOP data out. Nothing else in the app
ever touches the network, and your raw biometric streams never leave the device through
either exception.

Data enters NOOP three ways, and leaves it (other than the optional AI Coach) only when **you**
deliberately export it to another store on the **same device**:

| Path | Transport | Direction |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Live collection | Bluetooth LE, strap → device | Read-only from the strap |
| File import (Apple Health, WHOOP CSV, nutrition CSV) | User-selected files on disk | Read-only from disk |
| Oura history import (opt-in build flag, §1.1b) | HTTPS OAuth + REST, `api.ouraring.com` → device | Read-only from your own Oura account |
| Apple Health export, incl. iOS "Export for Shortcuts" | On-device, user-initiated | NOOP → your Apple Health, on your device only (§1.3) |

The only **network** paths are the opt-in AI Coach and the compile-time-optional Oura
history import; the
biometric pipeline produces no network traffic of any kind. The Apple Health export above is
an **on-device** hand-off, not a network upload — see §1.3.

### 1.1 Network code: only the two optional exceptions

The biometric pipeline and all five Swift packages
(`WhoopProtocol`, `WhoopStore`, `StrandAnalytics`, `StrandImport`, `StrandDesign`)
contain **no** use of `URLSession`, `URLRequest`, `NWConnection`, `dataTask`, or any
other networking API — still true after the Oura history import (§1.1b) landed: its OAuth
and REST calls live entirely in the app target, `Strand/Oura/`, and `StrandImport`
gained only pure, network-free parsers for Oura's payload shapes. These Swift packages
are **shared by the macOS and iOS apps** (iOS is build-from-source only — no App Store /
TestFlight — and was folded into the main tree in v1.94), so the Swift-side privacy
behaviour described here applies equally to both. Android is a separate codebase using
Room for storage and Kotlin for the BLE / import / Coach paths; its own Oura support is
the local BLE ring-pairing lane, not a network API, so it has no equivalent to §1.1b. The
**only** networking anywhere in the app is the AI Coach (`Strand/AI/AICoach.swift` on the
Swift side — macOS and iOS — `com.noop.ai.AiCoach` on Android), described in §1.1a, and
the Oura history import (`Strand/Oura/`, Swift-only — macOS and iOS), described in §1.1b.
The package manifests reference dependency *download* URLs that Swift Package Manager
resolves at build time, never at runtime:

```
Packages/WhoopStore/Package.swift   → https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift.git
Packages/StrandImport/Package.swift → https://github.com/weichsel/ZIPFoundation.git
```

GRDB.swift is the SQLite layer; ZIPFoundation is the archive reader used by the
importers. Neither opens a socket.

### 1.1a The AI Coach (optional, off by default, bring your own key)

The AI Coach lets you ask questions about your data in plain language. It is one of the
two features that use the network (the other is the Oura history import, §1.1b), and only
on your terms:

- **Off until you enable it.** You enter your own API key for the provider you choose
  (Anthropic, OpenAI, or a local / self-hosted OpenAI-compatible LLM such as Ollama or
  LM Studio). No key, no network calls, ever.
- **What is sent.** When you ask a question, NOOP builds a compact **text** summary of
  your recent metrics (Charge, Effort, Rest, HRV, resting HR over ~14 days, plus
  30-day averages and recent workouts) and sends it, with your question, directly to
  your chosen endpoint (e.g. `api.anthropic.com` / `api.openai.com` for the hosted
  providers). If you point the Coach at a local / self-hosted LLM, that endpoint is on
  your own machine and the request never leaves it.
- **What is NOT sent.** No raw biometric streams, no Bluetooth data, no account or
  device identifiers — only the summary text and your question.
- **Your key, your relationship.** The request goes from your device straight to the
  provider you picked, under your own account. NOOP runs no server in between and keeps
  no copy.

If you never enable the AI Coach and never build the Oura import in (§1.1b), NOOP makes
zero network connections — and in a default build, the Oura code isn't in the binary to
begin with.

### 1.1b The Oura history import (compiled out by default, bring your own OAuth app)

The Oura history import pulls your own historical Oura data into NOOP over Oura's official
API — a one-time, foreground backfill you trigger yourself, not an ongoing background sync
(nothing runs on a timer, at launch, or in the background):

- **Not in the binary unless you build it in.** Every file of the lane's network code
  (`Strand/Oura/*.swift` and its Data Sources card) sits behind the `OURA_CLOUD_IMPORT`
  compilation condition, which is **unset in every default build** — the release binaries
  and any plain `xcodegen && xcodebuild` from a clean checkout contain **zero Oura network
  code**, provably, at the byte level. The condition is set only by the untracked
  `Strand/Oura/OuraSecrets.xcconfig` you create yourself from the example template, which
  also carries your own Oura developer app's client ID/secret — so the code and the
  credentials arrive in the same deliberate act. Then the import runs only when you tap
  **"Import your Oura history"** in Data Sources. (Belt-and-braces, the runtime guard
  remains too: absent/blank credentials disable the lane — `OuraCredentials.fromBundle`.)
- **What is sent.** An OAuth authorization-code handshake — you sign into Oura's own
  consent page (`cloud.ouraring.com`) through Apple's system `ASWebAuthenticationSession`,
  not an in-app WebView NOOP controls — followed by bearer-token `GET` requests to
  `api.ouraring.com/v2/usercollection/*` carrying only your access token and the
  endpoint/date-range parameters needed to page through your history. No NOOP data rides
  along with these requests beyond the token itself.
- **What comes back.** Your own Oura data — sleep, readiness, activity, workouts, heart
  rate, and the other endpoints your granted scopes cover — flowing **in**, once, to seed
  your local database. Oura's own readiness/sleep scores are kept for reference only
  (`ref_*`/`oura_*` metric keys); NOOP's own Charge/Effort/Rest are never derived from
  them and are never sent anywhere.
- **What is NOT sent.** None of your existing NOOP data — no WHOOP streams, no other
  imports, no computed scores — ever leaves the device via this lane. It is inbound-only.
- **Your app, your grant, revocable at Oura.** You register your own OAuth app at Oura's
  developer portal; NOOP runs no server in between. Revoke access any time from your Oura
  account settings, or tap **Forget Oura access** in NOOP, which signs out locally and
  deletes the stored tokens plus every row this lane wrote — including the raw archive
  (`ouraRaw` table, see `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`).
- **Tokens in the Keychain, not a plist.** The access/refresh tokens are stored via
  `OuraTokenStore` as a single Keychain item (`kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlock`), the
  same pattern as the AI Coach's API key (`AIKeyStore`) — never UserDefaults, never on
  disk in the clear.

If you never build the lane in, your binary cannot call `ouraring.com` — the code is not there.

### 1.2 The macOS sandbox (and what it means for the AI Coach and the Oura import)

On macOS the App Sandbox is the backstop. The app ships with a minimal entitlement set
(`Strand/Resources/Strand.entitlements`):

```xml
<key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>                       <true/>
<key>com.apple.security.device.bluetooth</key>                  <true/>
<key>com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write</key>    <true/>
<key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>                    <true/>
```

That is the entire entitlement file. Four keys:

- **`app-sandbox`** — the process runs inside the macOS App Sandbox container.
- **`device.bluetooth`** — permits BLE access to talk to the strap. The matching
  `NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription` string (declared in `project.yml`) states
  plainly: *"NOOP connects directly to your WHOOP strap over Bluetooth to read heart
  rate, R-R intervals, battery, and sensor data locally on your Mac. Nothing leaves
  your device."*
- **`files.user-selected.read-write`** — lets the app read import files the user
  explicitly picks (and write the database in its own container).
- **`network.client`** — outbound socket access. Added for the AI Coach on a
  signed/sandboxed build, where the sandbox otherwise refuses any socket the app tries
  to open (#128); the Oura history import (§1.1b) now relies on the same entitlement. The
  ad-hoc distributed build applies **no** entitlements at all (unsigned build + ad-hoc
  re-sign), so this key only matters for a signed/sandboxed build. The entitlement only
  permits the socket the sandbox would otherwise refuse — it doesn't make either feature
  call out on its own; both stay off until you deliberately turn the Coach on or tap
  Connect Oura.

Notably **absent**:

- `com.apple.security.network.server` — no inbound listener.
- No `files.downloads`, `files.documents`, or any broad filesystem entitlement —
  the app cannot wander the disk; it sees only what the user hands it through the
  open panel, plus its own sandbox container.

This is the structural guarantee behind "offline by design" on macOS: the sandbox
permits exactly the two deliberate, opt-in exceptions above and nothing else — no
undeclared entitlement could smuggle out a connection the user didn't ask for. The
property is enforced by the OS, not merely by convention.

> **Note on Hardened Runtime.** `project.yml` currently sets
> `ENABLE_HARDENED_RUNTIME: NO` for local development builds. Distributable /
> notarized builds should enable the Hardened Runtime; it composes with, and does
> not weaken, the sandbox entitlements above.

### 1.3 iOS Apple Health export ("Export for Shortcuts") — on-device, user-initiated, one-way

On iOS NOOP can hand your metrics to **Apple Health**. This is the one path where data leaves
NOOP's own store — but it never leaves your **device**, and never touches the network.

- **You initiate it; NOOP writes only what you enable.** Nothing is exported automatically. You
  choose which metrics to push, and NOOP writes only those, only when you trigger the export. There
  is no background sync.
- **On-device, not a network upload.** The export is a local hand-off to Apple Health on the same
  phone. No NOOP server, no cloud, no telemetry is involved — consistent with §1.
- **HealthKit-free option.** The **"Export for Shortcuts"** path produces data for the Apple
  Shortcuts app rather than writing through HealthKit directly, so you can route it with a Shortcut
  you control. Where it does write to Apple Health, it does so through Apple's permission-gated APIs:
  you grant access per data type, and you can revoke it in iOS Settings at any time.
- **Once it's in Apple Health, it's yours and Apple's, not NOOP's.** NOOP cannot read back, manage,
  or delete what you exported; that store, its backups (e.g. iCloud Health if *you* enabled it), and
  its sharing settings are governed by Apple and by your choices. **You are responsible for the data
  you push into Apple Health and for anything you or your Shortcuts then do with it.** See
  `DISCLAIMER.md` §5.3 and `TERMS.md` §5.

## 2. Data at rest

### 2.1 Where the data lives

All durable data is stored in a single GRDB/SQLite database. The Swift apps (macOS and
iOS, which share the `WhoopStore` package) open it at (`Strand/Collect/StorePaths.swift`):

```
<Application Support>/OpenWhoop/whoop.sqlite
```

Because the app is sandboxed, `<Application Support>` resolves **inside the app's
sandbox container**, not the user's global `~/Library/Application Support`. Other
apps cannot read it through normal filesystem access. (On Android the equivalent store
is a Room/SQLite database in the app's private storage; the rest of this section
describes the GRDB/SQLite store shared by the macOS and iOS apps.)

The schema is defined by a versioned `DatabaseMigrator` in
`Packages/WhoopStore/Sources/WhoopStore/Database.swift` (currently schema version 9).
It holds exactly the kinds of data you would expect from the features:

- **Decoded biometric streams** (durable): `hrSample`, `rrInterval`, `spo2Sample`,
  `skinTempSample`, `respSample`, `gravitySample`, `battery`, `event`.
- **Derived/cached metrics**: `sleepSession`, `dailyMetric`, `workout`, `journal`,
  `appleDaily`, and the generic long-format `metricSeries`.
- **Your own entries and imports**: daily **mood check-ins** (the Mind feature) and imported
  **nutrition** figures (from a Cronometer / MacroFactor CSV) are stored the same way — locally, in
  this database, never transmitted. They are self-tracking notes, not clinical records (see
  `DISCLAIMER.md` §5).
- **A transient raw outbox** (`rawBatch`): compressed raw BLE frames, **prunable**.
- **Device records** (`device`): strap id, MAC, name, first/last-seen timestamps.

The database is opened in WAL journal mode with `synchronous = NORMAL` and a busy
timeout, tuned for bulk import/backfill writes
(`Packages/WhoopStore/Sources/WhoopStore/WhoopStore.swift`). WAL means you will also
see `whoop.sqlite-wal` and `whoop.sqlite-shm` sidecar files alongside the main
database — they live in the same container.

### 2.2 Encryption

The SQLite file is **not encrypted at rest by NOOP itself.** Confidentiality of the
data on disk relies on the platform:

- **FileVault** (full-disk encryption, on by default on modern Macs) protects the
  database whenever the disk is at rest / the machine is powered off. On iOS and
  Android the equivalent is the platform's on-by-default device encryption / data
  protection, which guards the file while the device is locked.
- The **sandbox container** (app container on macOS/iOS, private app storage on
  Android) keeps other user-space apps from reading the file directly.

What this does **not** protect against: an attacker with your unlocked, logged-in
session, or a backup/Time Machine copy of the container made while FileVault is
unlocked. The data is plaintext SQLite once the volume is mounted.

> **Option: SQLCipher.** GRDB supports SQLCipher (an encrypted SQLite build) as a
> drop-in. Wiring NOOP's `DatabaseQueue` to a SQLCipher build with a
> Keychain-derived key would give at-rest encryption independent of FileVault. This
> is not enabled in the current build, but the persistence layer is small and
> centralized (one `WhoopStore.init(path:)`), so it is a contained change.

### 2.3 Data minimization & pruning

The raw-frame outbox (`rawBatch`) is treated as transient, not as the system of
record — the decoded streams are durable, the raw frames are a compressed,
**prunable** buffer. The prune policy in
`Packages/WhoopStore/Sources/WhoopStore/RawOutbox.swift` deletes old batches:

```sql
DELETE FROM rawBatch WHERE syncedAt IS NOT NULL AND syncedAt < ?
```

So raw captures do not accumulate forever. (The `syncedAt`/upload-related columns are
schema scaffolding inherited from the upstream collection library; in NOOP's offline
configuration nothing uploads, and the raw buffer is purely a local replay/recovery
aid.)

### 2.4 Diagnostics: the strap connection log

When a strap won't connect or behaves oddly, the single most useful thing a user can
send is the connection log. NOOP keeps one so it can be shared **without** needing
`adb` or a developer setup (this is what made issues #17/#18 reportable), and the same
log doubles as the primary tool for **debugging and protocol development** (see
`ANDROID.md` → "Debugging the strap connection").

**What it is.** The BLE client (`android/.../ble/WhoopBleClient.kt`,
`Strand/BLE/BLEManager.swift` on the Swift side — macOS and iOS) keeps an **in-memory
ring buffer** — the last
2000 log lines on Android — of the connection's control flow: scan results (strap
advertised name + RSSI), the bond/handshake state machine, command names with their
outbound payload **hex**, and offload progress (trim cursors, chunk acks). It is held
in RAM only; the "Share strap log" button writes it to a private app-cache file at
share time and hands that file to the OS share sheet. Nothing is uploaded by NOOP.

**What it does *not* contain.** No account credentials (there is no account), no
decoded biometric *values* (heart-rate numbers, R-R intervals, SpO₂, skin-temp are not
written to the log — only control-plane command names and frame-routing), and no
hello-token or serial hex (the handshake lines log *that* a step happened, not its
secret payload). The one mild identifier is the strap's advertised name (e.g.
`WHOOP 5AG…`), which the user chooses to include when they tap Share.

**logcat is opt-in (debug mode), off by default.** By default the log is mirrored
**only** to the in-app buffer — it is *not* written to Android's system log
(`Log.d`/logcat). A user has no reason to emit the connection log to the device-wide
log, so they don't. Developers who want to watch a session live over
`adb logcat -s WhoopBleClient` turn on **Settings → Strap → "Debug logging"**
(persisted as `NoopPrefs.KEY_DEBUG_LOGGING`, default `false`); the flag drives
`WhoopBleClient.debugLogcat`, which gates the single `Log.d` call. The in-app buffer
and the "Share strap log" export work the same whether or not debug logging is on, so
the diagnostic path is always available without ever defaulting users into logcat.

### 2.5 Wrist alerts: the Android notification listener

Android wrist alerts (buzz the strap when chosen apps notify you) need a
`NotificationListenerService` — that's the only way to register in the OS's
**Notification Access** list and be told a notification was posted. Notification
access is a powerful permission, so for a privacy-first app it's worth being precise
about what NOOP does and does not do with it:

- **Off by default, double opt-in.** The service does nothing until you both grant
  Notification Access in system settings *and* turn on **Wrist alerts** in NOOP, then
  enable specific apps (each app is off by default).
- **It reads only the posting package name — never content.** On a posted
  notification NOOP looks at *which app* posted (and skips ongoing / foreground-service /
  group-summary noise), checks your settings (master toggle, that app's opt-in, quiet
  hours, only-when-worn), and if all pass, sends a haptic-pattern command to the strap.
  The notification's title, text, sender, and extras are never read, stored, logged, or
  transmitted.
- **Nothing leaves the device.** There is no server; the only output is a Bluetooth
  buzz to your own strap. (`android/.../notif/NoopNotificationListener.kt`.)

---

## 3. Threat model

NOOP parses two classes of **untrusted input**: bytes arriving over Bluetooth, and
files chosen for import. Both are treated as hostile and validated before anything
reaches the database. Apple Health and WHOOP files in particular can be very large
(multi-hundred-MB to multi-GB), so resource exhaustion is part of the model.

What is explicitly **out of scope**: NOOP cannot defend the data against an attacker
who already controls your unlocked user session (see §2.2), and it makes no claim of
cryptographic authentication of the strap — BLE pairing/bonding security is provided
by the OS Bluetooth stack and the device, not by NOOP.

### 3.1 Threat A: a malicious or malfunctioning BLE peer

A device advertising as a strap (or a glitching real strap) could send malformed,
truncated, oversized, or adversarial frames. The protocol core
(`Packages/WhoopProtocol/`) is the reverse-engineering layer and is the first line of
defense.

**CRC-gated parsing.** Every frame is checked against its checksums before it is
allowed to drive any application state. `Framing.swift` implements three checksums
verbatim from the wire formats:

- `crc8` (poly 0x07) over the length header,
- `crc32` (zlib/reflected) over the inner payload,
- `crc16Modbus` for the WHOOP 5.0 header (ported from the `goose` work).

`verifyFrame(_:)` (and the family-aware `verifyFrame(_:family:)`) only return
`ok == true` when the header CRC **and** the payload CRC32 both validate:

```swift
let ok = crc8OK && (crc32OK ?? false)
```

The live BLE path then refuses anything that fails. In
`Strand/BLE/FrameRouter.swift`:

```swift
let parsed = parseFrame(frame)
guard parsed.ok else { return }
// Reject frames that failed their checksum — never let bad bytes drive state.
if parsed.crcOK == false { return }
```

The same gate guards clock correlation (`Strand/Collect/ClockCorrelation.swift`
requires `parsed.ok, parsed.crcOK != false`), so a corrupt frame can neither update
the displayed metrics nor poison the device-clock model.

**Bounds-checked decoding.** Field reads never index past the end of the buffer. The
low-level readers in `Interpreter.swift` return `nil` instead of trapping when a read
would run off the end of the frame:

```swift
@inline(__always) private func readU16(_ f: [UInt8], _ off: Int) -> Int? {
    off + 2 <= f.count ? Int(f[off]) | (Int(f[off + 1]) << 8) : nil
}
```

Schema-driven field extraction skips any field whose offset is out of range
(`guard let val = readDType(frame, fld.off, dtype) else { continue }`), and the
`FieldBuilder` clamps every slice to the real buffer length
(`let end = min(off + length, frame.count)`). The WHOOP 5.0 path adds explicit
minimum-length and `payloadEnd <= frame.count` guards before slicing the payload or
trailer. A short or lying length field therefore yields a partial parse, never an
out-of-bounds read.

**Sane-value gating at the application edge.** Even a CRC-valid frame is range-checked
before it updates the UI/state. The realtime handler discards implausible heart rates
(`hr >= 30, hr <= 220`) and only overwrites R-R intervals when the frame actually
carries them — so a single bad-but-valid packet can't wipe good state.

**Reassembly is bounded by the declared length.** The `Reassembler` resynchronizes on
the `0xAA` start-of-frame byte, discards leading garbage, and only emits a frame once
`length + 4` bytes are present — it does not unboundedly buffer arbitrary data.

### 3.2 Threat B: a malicious import file (zip bombs, XML bombs, huge exports)

Both importers live in `Packages/StrandImport/` and assume the file is hostile.

**Apple Health (`AppleHealthImporter.swift`).** Apple Health exports routinely exceed
1 GB, and a malicious one could be far worse.

- **Streaming SAX parse, never DOM.** The importer parses with `XMLParser` /
  `XMLParserDelegate` over an `InputStream` opened directly on the file. It explicitly
  does **not** use `XMLParser(contentsOf:)`, which would load the whole multi-hundred-
  MB document into memory first. Element handling runs inside a per-element
  `autoreleasepool` so temporaries from tens of millions of elements drain instead of
  accumulating — peak memory stays bounded regardless of file size.
- **Zip-bomb cap on decompression.** When the input is a `.zip`, `export.xml` is
  extracted to a temp file in fixed-size chunks with a running budget; the moment the
  decompressed total crosses the ceiling, extraction aborts:

  ```swift
  var written = 0
  let cap = 8 << 30   // 8 GB decompressed ceiling — zip-bomb guard
  _ = try archive.extract(entry, bufferSize: 1 << 20) { chunk in
      written += chunk.count
      if written > cap { throw ImportError.xmlParseFailed("export.xml too large") }
      try handle.write(contentsOf: chunk)
  }
  ```

  Chunks go straight to disk, so a bomb cannot inflate RAM. This deliberately replaced
  an earlier pipe-fed parser that could deadlock or crash on a malformed export.
- **Robust error handling.** Parse failures are surfaced as typed `ImportError`s; the
  delegate distinguishes a genuinely malformed document from a benign empty/EOF
  condition rather than crashing.
- **Temp files are cleaned up** via `defer { try? FileManager.default.removeItem(at: tmp) }`.

**WHOOP CSV export (`WhoopExportImporter.swift`).** The WHOOP data export is a small
bundle of CSV files, but the same defensive posture applies.

- **Per-entry size ceiling.** Each CSV is capped at 256 MB
  (`maxEntryBytes = 256 << 20`). Folder imports skip any file larger than the cap;
  zip imports reject entries whose *declared* uncompressed size exceeds it **and**
  enforce a running byte budget during extraction, so a ZIP64 header that lies about
  its size is still stopped mid-stream:

  ```swift
  let declared = Int(exactly: entry.uncompressedSize) ?? Int.max
  if declared > Self.maxEntryBytes { continue }
  ...
  if written > Self.maxEntryBytes { throw CancellationError() }
  ```

- **CRC32 verification on extraction.** `archive.extract()` verifies each entry's
  CRC32 (ZIPFoundation's `skipCRC32` defaults to `false`) and throws on a mismatch or
  truncation. A corrupt/truncated/oversized entry is skipped entirely rather than
  partially imported — no half-rows reach the database.
- **Filename allow-list.** Only four known CSV names
  (`physiological_cycles.csv`, `sleeps.csv`, `workouts.csv`, `journal_entries.csv`)
  are ever read; everything else in the archive is ignored. Matching is by filename,
  case-insensitively, so the parser never executes or interprets arbitrary archive
  members.
- **Tolerant, header-name-driven parsing.** Columns are matched by normalized header
  name (not position), every column is optional, BOMs are stripped, and rows with no
  usable timestamp are dropped. Malformed input degrades to fewer rows, not a crash.

**Nutrition CSV (`NutritionCsvImport.swift`).** The nutrition importer (Cronometer /
MacroFactor daily-summary exports) reuses the same shared CSV reader (`CSVParsing.swift`)
and the same tolerant posture: headers are matched case-insensitively by name (date /
calories / protein / carbs / fat / weight), every column is optional, non-`yyyy-MM-dd`
dates and value-less rows are **skipped and counted, never fatal**, and only the
recognised numeric fields are read — no archive member or cell is ever executed or
interpreted. The result is projected into the long-format `metricSeries` store under the
dedicated source id `nutrition-csv`, alongside your other metrics and entirely on-device.

---

## 4. What NOOP does *not* collect or transmit

- **No NOOP account, no NOOP login.** Nothing to sign into with NOOP itself; NOOP
  issues no credentials of its own. The one exception is opt-in: the Oura history import
  (§1.1b) has *you* sign into *your own* Oura account, at Oura's own login page, over
  OAuth — NOOP never sees your Oura password, only the resulting tokens, kept in the
  Keychain.
- **No telemetry / analytics / crash reporting.** No third-party SDKs of that kind.
- **No cloud, no sync, no remote backup of NOOP's own data.** Your NOOP data never
  leaves the machine via NOOP. The Oura history import (§1.1b) is the one path that
  reaches a cloud service, and it is **inbound only** — it pulls your own Oura data in;
  it does not sync or back up any NOOP data out.
- **No advertising identifiers, no tracking.**
- **No WHOOP account or API credentials.** NOOP talks only to the strap over local
  BLE; it does not authenticate against, or pull from, any WHOOP server. (Oura is the
  one account-based exception — see above and §1.1b.)

## 5. Hardening summary

| Surface | Risk | Mitigation | Where |
|---------|------|------------|-------|
| Process | Data exfiltration / network egress | Only two opt-in features network: the AI Coach (your key, to your chosen provider, a text summary — §1.1a) and the Oura history import (your own OAuth app, to `api.ouraring.com`, inbound-only — §1.1b). Nothing else makes a network call, and nothing is sent until you ask. Both work on Android/iOS where shipped (Android's Oura support is local-BLE only, no cloud lane); on macOS both cross the sandbox on the same `network.client` entitlement, present since #128 (§1.2) | `Strand/AI/AICoach.swift`, `Strand/Oura/`, `android/.../ai/AiCoach.kt` |
| Oura history import | OAuth token / scope leakage, cross-account data mixing | Compiled out by default (`OURA_CLOUD_IMPORT`, §1.1b); tokens Keychain-only (`kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlock`, never UserDefaults/plist); fixed OAuth scopes set at build time; raw + normalized rows partitioned under `deviceId = "oura-api"`; Oura's own scores kept reference-only (`ref_*`/`oura_*` metricSeries keys, never NOOP's Charge/Effort/Rest); `.cloudImport` is structurally priority-2 so it never seizes a WHOOP day; Forget Oura access purges tokens + every `oura-api` row incl. the raw archive | `Strand/Oura/OuraTokenStore.swift`, `Strand/Oura/OuraConnectModel.swift`, `Packages/WhoopStore/Sources/WhoopStore/OuraRawStore.swift` |
| Filesystem | Broad disk access | Only `files.user-selected.read-write`; data stays in the sandbox container | `Strand.entitlements`, `Strand/Collect/StorePaths.swift` |
| BLE frames | Malformed / adversarial packets | CRC8 + CRC32 (+ CRC16 for v5) gating; reject on failure | `WhoopProtocol/Framing.swift`, `Strand/BLE/FrameRouter.swift` |
| BLE frames | Out-of-bounds reads from short/lying length | `nil`-returning bounds-checked readers; slice clamping; min-length guards | `WhoopProtocol/Interpreter.swift` |
| BLE frames | Garbage / partial fragments | SOF-resync reassembler bounded by declared length | `WhoopProtocol/Framing.swift` (`Reassembler`) |
| App state | Implausible-but-valid values | Range gates (e.g. HR 30–220) at the state edge | `Strand/BLE/FrameRouter.swift` |
| Health import | XML bomb / multi-GB DOM blowup | Streaming SAX over `InputStream`; per-element autorelease pool | `StrandImport/AppleHealthImporter.swift` |
| Health import | Zip bomb | 8 GB decompressed ceiling, chunked to disk, hard abort | `StrandImport/AppleHealthImporter.swift` |
| CSV import | Zip bomb / oversized entries | 256 MB per-entry cap (declared + running budget); CRC32 verify | `StrandImport/WhoopExportImporter.swift` |
| CSV import | Arbitrary archive members | Filename allow-list; tolerant optional-column parsing | `StrandImport/WhoopExportImporter.swift` |
| Data at rest | Disk theft / offline access | Relies on FileVault + sandbox container; SQLCipher available as an option | `WhoopStore/WhoopStore.swift` |
| Diagnostics log | Leaking the strap log to the device-wide system log | In-app ring buffer only; logcat mirroring is **opt-in** (Settings → Strap → "Debug logging", default off); no biometric values / tokens logged (§2.4) | `android/.../ble/WhoopBleClient.kt` (`debugLogcat`), `android/.../ui/MainActivity.kt` (`NoopPrefs`) |

## 7. Credits

The protocol and persistence work NOOP builds on is community reverse-engineering of
hardware the user owns, used for interoperability:

- **`johnmiddleton12/my-whoop`** — the WHOOP 4.0 BLE framing/command/decode work and
  the collection logic the `WhoopProtocol` / `WhoopStore` packages and the app's
  collection layer are adapted from.
- **`b-nnett/goose`** — the WHOOP 5.0 protocol (the `fd4b0001-…` service family, the
  CRC16-Modbus header, and the "puffin" packet types) the v5 decode path is ported
  from.
- **`groue/GRDB.swift`** — the SQLite persistence layer.
- **`weichsel/ZIPFoundation`** — the archive reader used by the importers.

See `ATTRIBUTION.md` and `DISCLAIMER.md` for the full attribution and good-faith
notice. NOOP contains no WHOOP proprietary code, firmware, binaries, logos, or
assets, and performs no DRM circumvention.

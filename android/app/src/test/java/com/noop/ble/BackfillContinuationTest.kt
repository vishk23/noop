/**
 * Pins the #364 historical-sync auto-continue decision ([WhoopBleClient.shouldAutoContinue]). The real
 * bug: the strap offloads OLDEST-first at ~60s/session with a 15-min floor and NO auto-continue, so on a
 * deep backlog each connection drains only the oldest pass then waits — "last night" can take many
 * connections to reach even while the strap stays connected. The predicate decides whether a session that
 * ended on the 60s IDLE cap (not a true HISTORY_COMPLETE) should immediately re-kick instead of tearing
 * down to the floor. Pure → no live GATT stack needed; mirrors the Swift BackfillContinuationTests
 * byte-for-behaviour.
 *
 * #928 pinned here too: the predicate takes the REAL wall clock (`wallNowUnix`) so a strap clock set in
 * the FUTURE (a "newest" more than 48 h ahead of the wall) is excluded from the backlog test instead of
 * reading as endless backlog. Fixtures pass an explicit wall-now consistent with their timestamps.
 * #1012 tightens it: a future-dated newest now stops guard 2b as well — its "real rows" are future-dated
 * too, so the drain ends after one pass instead of chasing the future range through the whole cap.

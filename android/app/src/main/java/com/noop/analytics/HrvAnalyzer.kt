/*
 * HrvAnalyzer.kt — RMSSD + SDNN from RR intervals with cleaning.
 *
 * Faithful Kotlin port of StrandAnalytics/HRVAnalyzer.swift (verified on macOS).
 * The Task Force (1996) RMSSD and SDNN definitions are reproduced exactly:
 *
 *   RMSSD = sqrt( mean( (NN[i+1] − NN[i])^2 ) )           (Task Force 1996)
 *   SDNN  = sample standard deviation of NN (ddof = 1)     (Task Force 1996)
 *
 * Cleaning pipeline:
 *   1. Range filter: drop intervals outside [RR_MIN_MS, RR_MAX_MS] = [300, 2000] ms.
 *   2. Ectopic rejection: drop beats whose RR deviates > ~20% from a local median
 *      (Malik-style filter).
 *   3. Require >= MIN_BEATS (20) valid intervals before a trustworthy result.
 *
 * Gap-aware successive differences: cleaning DROPS beats, which makes two beats that were not
 * adjacent in the source become neighbours in the cleaned list. A successive-difference metric
 * (RMSSD, pNN50) must NOT count the difference across such a splice, or one removed beat injects a
 * spurious large delta that dominates the mean. [cleanRRGapAware] cleans while remembering where beats
 * were dropped, and [rmssdGapAware] / [pnn50GapAware] skip any difference that straddles a gap. On a
 * series with no drops these are identical to the plain versions, so clean data is unchanged. Kept in
 * lockstep with the Swift twin `StrandAnalytics/HRVAnalyzer.cleanRRGapAware` / `rmssdGapAware` /
 * `pnn50GapAware` (ported alongside; both platforms are gap-aware).
 *
 * Named [HrvAnalyzer] (NOT Hrv) to avoid clashing with the existing
 * com.noop.analytics.Hrv object in Analytics.kt. The two compute RMSSD the same
 * way (sqrt of mean successive squared diffs); HrvAnalyzer additionally cleans
 * the RR series and reports SDNN / meanNN / pNN50.

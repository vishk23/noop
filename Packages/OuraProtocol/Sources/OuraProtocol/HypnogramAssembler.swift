// HypnogramAssembler: reconstruct the TIME AXIS of the ring's sleep-phase hypnogram.
//
// THE PROBLEM (observed on-device 2026-07-12, Gen3): the ring's SleepNet finalizes a night's staging
// AFTER wake and writes the whole hypnogram to its event log in ONE BURST — e.g. 23 records x 52 codes,
// all sharing essentially the same envelope ring-time (~09:30, the WRITE moment). The envelope
// timestamp therefore marks WHEN THE ANALYSIS WAS SAVED, not when the sleep happened; anchoring each
// record at its envelope collapses an entire night onto a few seconds.
//
// THE RECONSTRUCTION: the burst's codes are one contiguous sequence at 30 s/code, ENDING at the burst's
// envelope time. Laying N codes backward from the anchored burst end recovers the real window. The
// 30 s epoch is triple-confirmed: open_oura's sleepnet.md ("DEEP/LIGHT/REM/WAKE classification at
// 30-second intervals"), the observed window math (1,196 codes over a ~23:35-09:00 night), and the
// 0x49 summary's 600-minute window over those same 1,196 codes (~30.1 s/code).
//
// Platform-pure, value types + one small accumulator class; no CoreBluetooth, no clock (the caller
// resolves the anchored end time). Builds and tests on Linux.

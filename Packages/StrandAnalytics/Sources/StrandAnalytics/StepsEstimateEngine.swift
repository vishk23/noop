/// Estimate daily steps for a WHOOP 4.0 from the strap's MOTION, calibrated per-user against a phone
/// step count (Apple Health / Health Connect).
///
/// WHY THIS IS A CALIBRATED ESTIMATE, NOT A PEDOMETER. A WHOOP 4.0 does not send a step count over BLE,
/// and the accelerometer/gravity data we DO get is sparse (~one vector per stored record, roughly minute
/// granularity) — far below the ~25–50 Hz a true step counter needs to see individual footfalls. So we
/// cannot count steps. What we CAN measure is movement VOLUME (how much the gravity vector moved over the
/// day), and we map that volume to steps with a coefficient learned from days where the phone ALSO counted
/// steps. The output is always framed as an estimate.
///
/// THE MODEL. `steps ≈ k · motionIntensity`, a through-origin fit (no steps ⇒ no motion). `k` (steps per
/// unit of motion) is the only free parameter, and it is PERSONAL — it depends on wrist vs hip placement,
/// gait, and how the strap rides — which is exactly why it's calibrated to each user rather than a global
/// constant. We fit `k` robustly (a MOTION-WEIGHTED median of per-day `steps/motion` ratios) so a single odd
/// day (a drive, a workout that's all arms, a phone left at home) can't drag the whole calibration. The
/// weighting is the point of #682: a busy 15,000-step day pins the ratio far more reliably than a near-still
/// 500-step day (more footfalls ⇒ less ratio noise), so we let motion VOLUME drive the fit instead of letting
/// every day count equally. A user with no phone step history to fit against can set `k` manually with the
/// calibration slider.

// ResonanceEngine.swift — find a user's personal resonance-frequency breathing pace by sweeping candidate
// paces and measuring which one maximises respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) amplitude. PURE + DB-free;
// the live session controller (per platform) paces each candidate via `BreathPacer` + the buzz path,
// feeds the clean R-R it ingested per pace back in here, and persists the locked pace as a pref.
//
// See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-19-v5-haptic-biofeedback-design.md (L1 "Detect (the sweep)").
//
// THEORY (Lehrer/Gevirtz, approach not code): there is a personal pace — usually 4.5–7 br/min — at which
// the 0.1 Hz baroreflex and RSA align and the heart-rate oscillation amplitude peaks. We find it by
// pacing the user through candidate paces and reading the RSA response at each.
//
// RSA amplitude (per pace): the heart speeds up on the inhale and slows on the exhale; once-per-breath
// that produces a peak-to-trough swing in the instantaneous HR (60000/RR). We know each breath cycle's
// boundaries because WE paced them (from `BreathPacer`/the pace's cycle length), so we measure the mean
// peak-to-trough swing of instantaneous HR WITHIN each paced breath cycle. That mean swing is the RSA
// amplitude; it peaks at the resonance pace. RMSSD (via the shared `HRVAnalyzer`) corroborates / breaks ties.
//
// HONEST LIMITS (stated in the spec): WHOOP R-R is PPG-derived, not ECG — RSA amplitude / HF-HRV are
// ESTIMATES, never clinical readings. A pace with too few clean beats is left UNSCORED rather than
// guessed; if fewer than `minScoredPaces` score, we report "no lock" and fall back to the 5.5 br/min
// coherence pace. We never claim the pace is permanent — the caller dates it; it drifts.

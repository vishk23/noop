/**
 * The report-completeness guard. Swift's architectural counterpart is `CaptureCompleteness` (there is no
 * Swift type named ReportCompleteness). A report is only useful
 * if the active mode's KILLER TRACE actually landed in report.txt. The Test Centre's whole point is that
 * each domain emits one upfront, hard-to-miss line that settles the bug; if a tester toggles a mode but
 * the emitter never fires (strap never connected, no scored day, the import never ran), the .zip looks
 * full but carries nothing diagnostic. This guard reads report.txt back and reports, per active domain,
 * whether its killer-trace token is present, so a maintainer (and the tester, via the review sheet) sees
 * "Sleep: MISSING" before the report ships rather than after a round-trip.
 *
 * The {domain -> token} map below is the SINGLE source of truth FOR THIS PLATFORM, and is deliberately
 * NOT byte-identical to Swift's. It cannot be: each side keys on the tokens ITS OWN emitters actually
 * write, and the two platforms word several of those lines differently. Of the ten killer tokens, four
 * match Swift exactly, three differ only by a trailing fragment, and three have no counterpart in the
 * Swift map at all -- import (`import parser=` vs `import stage=`), steps (`stepsEst ` vs `stepsRaw`)
 * and battery (`battery series=` vs `bank soc=`). Aligning them would break this guard, because the
 * token has to match the line Android emits. Each token is the distinctive, stable leading fragment of that
 * domain's killer trace (verified against the trace emitters and their unit tests): a SUBSTRING match is
 * deliberate so the per-day / per-record suffix (counts, ids, ISO dates) can vary without breaking the
 * check. The UNIVERSAL token (`dayOwner day=`) rides every export, so it is checked on every report.
 *
 * Pure + side-effect-free (no clock, no IO): the assembler passes the assembled report.txt text and the
 * active-domain set, and gets back the lines to append. No PII (tokens are fixed format fragments). No
 * em-dashes. Tested directly on the JVM by ReportCompletenessContractTest, which pins THIS map -- it
 * does not read the Swift side and cannot detect drift there. Cross-platform parity of the SECTION the
 * user reads (labels, ordering, present/MISSING wording) is the contract that matters here; identical
 * tokens are not, and were never achievable.

/// On-demand "take an HRV reading now" — the single-value spot RMSSD path (#537).
///
/// Swift parity twin of `android/.../analytics/SpotHrvReading.kt`. This wraps NOOP's canonical
/// `HRVAnalyzer` for the LIVE, user-triggered HRV snapshot the Live screen captures over ~60 s of
/// beat-to-beat (R-R) intervals. It exists so the spot value, its honesty gate, and its data-quality
/// caveat live in ONE tested place rather than being re-derived in the view.
///
/// Why delegate to `HRVAnalyzer` (and NOT roll our own RMSSD):
///  - RMSSD is the textbook root-mean-square of successive R-R differences:
///        RMSSD = sqrt( mean( (RR[i+1] - RR[i])^2 ) )   in ms.
///  - NOOP's nightly HRV (`avgHrv`, fed into Vitality / Fitness Age) uses `HRVAnalyzer.rmssdRaw`, which
///    takes the Task Force (1996) SAMPLE denominator (n-1) over the cleaned NN series. To keep a spot
///    reading COMPARABLE to the overnight number a user sees elsewhere, this path computes RMSSD the
///    SAME way (same cleaning pipeline, same (n-1) denominator). Using a population (n) denominator
///    would make the same beats read a few percent lower than the nightly figure, which is misleading.
///    Consistency with the existing scorer is the whole point.
///
/// Honesty is built in, not bolted on:
///  - A number is returned ONLY when enough CLEAN beats survive (`HRVAnalyzer.minBeats`); otherwise the
///    result is `.insufficient` with the surviving/needed counts so the UI can say so plainly (never a
///    fabricated value, unknown stays the "no value" glyph).
///  - The caveat (`caveatFor`) is source-aware: a 60 s spot reading is not the overnight baseline, it
///    needs enough beats, and R-R derived from a WHOOP 5/MG's optical PPG is noisier than a chest
///    strap's electrical R-R. Pure strings, US-neutral, no em-dashes.
///
/// Pure arithmetic + small value types, no I/O — fully unit-testable against a known RR series.

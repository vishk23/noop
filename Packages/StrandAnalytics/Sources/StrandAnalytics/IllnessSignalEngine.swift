// IllnessSignalEngine.swift — multi-signal "Heads-Up" early-warning with explicit false-positive
// suppression. Pure, deterministic, DB-free.
//
// INDEPENDENT implementation of the published multi-parameter pre-symptomatic signature documented
// across the wearable literature (e.g. the Stanford/Snyder resting-HR-elevation work and successor
// studies): resting HR ↑, skin temperature ↑, HRV (RMSSD) ↓ and respiration ↑ tend to move TOGETHER,
// days before symptoms. NOOP re-derives the PATTERN, transparently, against the user's OWN rolling
// baseline — never a population cutoff.
//
// This replaces the blunt 2-of-4 threshold rule in AppModel.evaluateIllness with:
//   • a calibrated 0–100 composite anomaly score (so the surface can read "mild" vs "strong"),
//   • a minimum-corroboration gate (≥ 2 signals) so a single noisy night never fires,
//   • EXPLICIT confounder suppression cross-checked against the same-day journal tags
//     (alcohol / stress / sauna / late-or-intense workout / travel), which is the differentiating
//     part — alcohol elevates RHR + skin temp and crushes HRV exactly like early illness, so a night
//     out must NOT cry wolf,
//   • a visible "why" (which signals fired) AND "what was ruled out" (which confounders were present),
//   • honest gating: a trusted baseline is required; below that the engine is silent.
//
// WELLNESS ONLY — APPROXIMATE, NOT A DIAGNOSIS. The engine never names a condition, illness, infection
// or fever; the copy is always "a heads-up to rest" / "consider taking it easy" (see the shipped
// IllnessNotifier copy: "On-device estimate (approximate) — not a diagnosis").

// MARK: - Stages (read-only Today host card) (#today-hosted-cards)
//
// The Sleep tab's "Stages" hero is deeply STATEFUL/INTERACTIVE (night ◀/▶ navigation, a wake-time edit
// button, and nap add/edit/delete), so it can NOT be mirrored onto the Today glance surface the way the
// other hosted cards are. Instead this file hosts a READ-ONLY latest-night Stages card: it renders the
// CURRENT `model.night` (the SAME night + intervals the Sleep tab shows) with none of the interactive
// chrome — a plain header (no chevrons), the sleep-window times (no wake-edit pencil), the shared stage
// chart + breakdown, and a read-only Main/Nap(s)/Total split (no Add/edit/delete).
//
// PARITY IS ON THE DATA: the stage chart is the SAME renderer the Sleep tab uses, lifted verbatim into
// the self-contained `StageDetailView` below (its own local `selectedStage` tap-highlight + `nightHR`
// state — transient per-instance UI, never SleepView's state). `SleepView` itself is UNCHANGED: it keeps
// its own fully-interactive `hero`/`stageCard`/`sleepWindowRow`/`napSection`. Only the Today host renders
// `StagesCard`.

/// The read-only "Stages" card hosted in Today: latest night's stage chart + breakdown, window times and
/// nap split, rendered from the shared [SleepModel] — no navigation, no edit, no nap mutation.

            // The shared stage chart + breakdown (verbatim of the Sleep tab's stageCard display). This is
            // the WHOLE hosted card — the clock-window row + Main/Nap split are deliberately dropped for
            // cross-platform feature parity: the Kotlin `SleepModel` carries no session timestamps/nap
            // blocks, so the Android host card shows the same chart + breakdown and nothing more. The
            // shared/parity data (the stage split) is identical on both platforms.

// `Night` + `intervals`. It owns its OWN transient UI state — `selectedStage` (tap-highlight) and
// `nightHR` (the sleeping-HR trace) — so tapping a stage in Today never reaches into SleepView. Every
// method below is a VERBATIM lift of the corresponding `SleepView` helper; the `SleepView` originals are

/**
 * Pure, deterministic encoder for ONE line of the Oura activity (0x50 MET) research corpus — the Kotlin
 * twin of Swift `OuraActivityDumpLine`. Byte-identical output (fixed key order; `met` via Kotlin's
 * shortest round-trip [Double.toString], which matches Swift's `String(_:)` across the MET value range),
 * so the two platforms' JSONL corpora are interchangeable.
 *
 * WHY a sidecar and not a stream/table: the 0x50 activity/MET decode is Tier-B (a plausible third-party
 * formula, not ground-truth-validated — OURA_PROTOCOL.md s6.13). The honest-data invariant forbids Tier-B
 * ever minting a durable scoring row, so it must never touch the datastore. This corpus is a separate,
 * clearly-labelled diagnostic file the app appends to purely so the raw MET series can be accumulated for
 * offline investigation. It never feeds scoring and is safe to delete.
 *
 * FORMAT: newline-delimited JSON (JSONL) — one record per line, append-only. The line is hand-built in a
 * FIXED key order so it is stable and testable byte-for-byte.

     * (e.g. `oura-<uuid>`) and `iso` is app-generated, so neither needs JSON string-escaping here.
     *   - ringTs:       the record's raw ring-clock timestamp (the dedup key: strictly increases per record).
     *   - utc:          the anchored wall-clock (unix seconds) for the record envelope.
     *   - iso:          human-readable UTC of `utc` (convenience for eyeballing).
     *   - state:        the raw 0x50 state byte (semantics unconfirmed — captured verbatim for study).
     *   - secPerSample: the ASSUMED per-sample cadence (60 s); downstream can recompute from `utc` deltas.
     *   - met:          the decoded per-sample MET series (Tier-B formula output, verbatim).

// MARK: - WHOOP MG ECG ("Labrador") packet decode + command construction
//
// The WHOOP MG carries ECG electrodes in its conductive clasp (a plain WHOOP 5.0 does not — see
// `Whoop5Variant`). The strap's ECG subsystem is called "Labrador" in the protocol tables, and it is a
// SEPARATE realtime data type from the R-numbered `StrapSensorData` layouts this package already decodes:
// there is a FILTERED stream (live, display-ready) and a RAW stream (persisted on the strap for later
// offload). Both carry the same 17-byte status header; they differ only in what follows it.
//
// Provenance — and the line this file does not cross.
//
// The four command NUMBERS are already in this repo's own protocol table
// (`Resources/whoop_protocol.json`, `CommandNumber`), carried over from the upstream whoomp/goose
// reverse-engineering credited in ATTRIBUTION.md:
//     123 (0x7B) SELECT_WRIST · 124 (0x7C) TOGGLE_LABRADOR_DATA_GENERATION
//     125 (0x7D) TOGGLE_LABRADOR_RAW_SAVE · 139 (0x8B) TOGGLE_LABRADOR_FILTERED
// The packet FIELD LAYOUTS and the command PAYLOAD shapes below are protocol facts sourced from static
// analysis of the official iOS client (per the #822 precedent: facts are admissible with attribution;
// implementation expression is not). Nothing here is copied — every line is NOOP's own code, in NOOP's
// own style, and no WHOOP code, firmware or asset is present.
//
// What is NOT established, and is therefore never asserted:
//   • The packet TYPE byte these records arrive under. No capture exists, and the repo's `PacketType`
//     table has no Labrador entry. So this file decodes a PAYLOAD, and the app layer discovers the type
//     empirically: it runs `filteredBytesPerSampleCandidates` over unclassified frames, and — because a
//     heuristic that only logs its own hits destroys the evidence for its own misses — CENSUSES every
//     unclassified frame by type byte whether the triage passed or not (`Whoop5EcgProbe.FrameCensus`).
//   • The filtered stream's BYTES PER SAMPLE. `decodeFiltered` implements 2, which is what the filtered
//     layout is documented with; the triage admits 2, 3 and 4, because a populated RAW record read off
//     hardware turned out to be 3 bytes/sample and a hardcoded 2 in the triage silently discarded every
//     frame that disagreed. See `filteredWidthCandidates`.
//   • The `WristSelection` raw values. `right` is listed first in the client's enum, so right=0/left=1 is
//     the natural reading — but it is an INFERENCE, not an attested fact, and it is labelled as such
//     everywhere it surfaces (including in the UI, because picking the wrong one writes the wrong
//     persistent value to the strap).
//   • The `heartKeyProgress` "timed out" sentinel. The client's type is a union of a percentage and a
//     timed-out case; the sentinel VALUE is not attested, so an out-of-range byte is carried raw rather
//     than renamed into a state we cannot prove it means.
//   • Any clinical meaning whatsoever. `ArrhythmiaCheckResult` is computed ON-STRAP by an embedded
//     third-party classifier and simply arrives in every packet. NOOP decodes the byte. NOOP is not a
//     medical device and this value is not a diagnosis — see DISCLAIMER.md and the UI copy.
//
// The Kotlin twin is `com.noop.protocol.Whoop5Ecg` — keep the two byte-identical.

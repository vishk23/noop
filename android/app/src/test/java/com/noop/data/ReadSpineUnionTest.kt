/**
 * HIGH-2 READ-SPINE UNION (#814 parity, Android twin of the Swift ReadSpineActiveDeviceTests):
 *
 * After a remove+re-add the strap gets a FRESH registry id ("whoop-<uuid>") and the Collector writes LIVE
 * raw under THAT id, but the WHOOP-export IMPORT path ([com.noop.ingest.WhoopCsvImporter.importZip]) keeps
 * writing under the CANONICAL "my-whoop" (its `deviceId` arg defaults to "my-whoop" and is never
 * overridden), and the computed history derived from that import lives under "my-whoop-noop". So the
 * dashboard read must resolve the UNION of (active id) AND the canonical "my-whoop"/"my-whoop-noop", or the
 * entire import is ORPHANED after a re-add.
 *
 * These exercise the PURE companion seams the merged reads ([daysMerged] / [recentDaysMergedFlow] /
 * [FusionDayAdapter]) are built on, so they run on the JVM with no Room:
 *   - [WhoopRepository.importedSourceIdsFor] / [WhoopRepository.computedSourceIdsFor] give the union ids;
 *   - [WhoopRepository.unionByDay] is the per-day active-wins de-dupe;
 *   - [WhoopRepository.mergeDaily] is the imports-win-over-computed cross-bucket merge.

/**
 * "~X days left" for a strap, worked out from its battery state-of-charge (SoC) history (#713). Neither
 * the WHOOP app nor WHOOP's API ever give you a runtime estimate, but NOOP already banks a SoC time
 * series from the strap over BLE, so no manual logging is needed. We fit the recent DISCHARGE slope and
 * divide the current charge by it. When the discharge run is too short or too flat to trust, we fall back
 * to the device's typical full-charge life for its generation.
 *
 * The measured slope already bakes in how the user actually runs their strap (HR broadcast, strain,
 * recording), so there are no hand-tuned usage multipliers. The discharge curve IS the personalisation.
 *
 * Honest about the limits: battery drain is non-linear (faster near full and near empty) and the strap
 * reports SoC sparsely, so this is an estimate, not a guarantee. Behaviour-identical twin of the Swift
 * BatteryEstimator (same fixtures, same numbers).

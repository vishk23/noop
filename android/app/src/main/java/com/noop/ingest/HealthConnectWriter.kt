 *    on re-insert the way HealthKit does — without a client id every 15-min recompute would stack
 *    duplicates. With it, HC upserts: same id + higher [Metadata.clientRecordVersion] replaces, so

     * FALSE, deliberately, and it is not an oversight to be tidied away.
     *
     * This export loop reads only the COMPUTED NOOP device rows — imported rows never pass through it —
     * so before v34 populated `spo2Pct` for WHOOP nights this branch never fired even once. Turning the
     * field on therefore does not "resume" an export; it STARTS one, and what it would start writing is a
     * number nobody has checked against a reference oximeter.
     *
     * Why that bar is higher here than for the in-app card. A value in the app is read in context, next
     * to its own provenance, by the person who built it. A Health Connect record is different in kind: it
     * lands in the system health record under Android's own Blood Oxygen heading, sits alongside
     * clinically-sourced readings with nothing distinguishing it, and is readable by every other app the
     * user has authorised. Deleting it later is fiddly and does not recall what already propagated.
     *
     * The evidence genuinely does not reach that bar yet. The decode is well supported — distribution,
     * run structure, sleep gating, night-to-night stability — but ALL of it says "this byte is a real
     * oxygen measurement", none of it says "97 means 97". Upstream declines to promote the same metric
     * for the same reason: two straps were checked against the WHOOP app and moved in OPPOSITE directions.
     *
     * Flip this to `true` (in lockstep with the Swift constant, or the platforms disagree about what
     * leaves the device) once paired reference-oximeter nights exist and the bias is characterised — and,
     * if the bias is a fixed offset, correct for it before writing rather than here.

/**
 * Application entry point.
 *
 * NOOP is a fully on-device WHOOP companion: it connects to the strap over BLE and persists
 * everything locally via Room. There is no network layer (the opt-in AI Coach aside).
 *
 * The data layer ([WhoopRepository]) and the BLE client ([WhoopBleClient]) are owned **here**, at the
 * process level, rather than by the Activity-scoped AppViewModel. That is what lets a connection keep
 * streaming when the app is backgrounded or closed: [com.noop.ble.WhoopConnectionService] holds the
 * process up with a foreground notification, and both it and the UI share this one BLE client. The
 * macOS app gets the same outcome for free — its `AppModel` is an app-level `@StateObject` kept alive
 * by the menu-bar extra.

/**
 * StressModel.build carry (#543). The Today "Stress" metric derives against a 30-day RHR/HRV baseline.
 * Today's own daily row is often vitals-less until the overnight is analyzed (especially right after an
 * app update relaunches and re-runs the analyze pass), and every OTHER Today vital carries last night's
 * value — Stress used to be the one card that didn't, so it dropped to "Calibrating" while the rest showed
 * numbers. These pin the carry: score the newest day that actually has RHR/HRV. Twin of the Swift
 * StressModelCarryTests.

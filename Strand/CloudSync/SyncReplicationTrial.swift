/// The on/off switch and launch hook for the page-replication device trial.
///
/// ## What the trial is for
///
/// `noop-cloud`'s current sync uploads the whole database (153.4 MB, 90–150 s) on every sync. The
/// replacement ships WAL frames instead. The one number that decides whether that is a 25–380× win
/// or a full upload with extra steps is **how often a push degrades to a full snapshot**, and it
/// cannot be reasoned about — iOS relaunches the process constantly, and a replicator that loses its
/// resume offset re-uploads everything. It has to be measured on VK's device, on VK's data.
///
/// Enabling the trial does two things and nothing else:
///
/// 1. hands WAL checkpointing to an external replicator (`StoreReplication.configure(.external)`),
///    which is the precondition for a replicator to see every transaction; and
/// 2. records one `SyncPushObservation` per push (`SyncPushTelemetry`).
///
/// It uploads nothing differently. Today's `/ingest` path is untouched, so the trial's downside is
/// bounded to "the WAL is now checkpointed by the backstop at 64 MiB instead of by SQLite at 4 MB."
///
/// ## Default: off
///
/// `.external` is a real commitment — with autocheckpoint disabled, WAL growth is bounded only by
/// `WalBackstopPolicy` (see `WalCheckpointing`'s obligation note, and the measured 166 MB/day). It
/// stays off until VK turns it on, on his own device, and it is a plain `UserDefaults` flag rather
/// than a Keychain item because it is a preference, not a secret.

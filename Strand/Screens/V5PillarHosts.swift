// V5PillarHosts.swift — the thin Wave-3 host wrappers that feed the two PURE v5 pillar screens
// (FusedRecordView + RhythmView) the engine results they take by init. The views own only
// presentation and previews from a fixture; these hosts do the I/O — they load the rows the store
// already holds, run the pure engine, and hand the result down. Self-contained: each takes the
// Repository / AppModel via the environment, exactly like every other screen.
//
// Mounted as reachable nav destinations by RootView (macOS sidebar) + RootTabView (iOS More list)
// and reachable via NavRouter deep-links from the Health / Devices&Sources hubs.

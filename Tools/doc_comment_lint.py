"""Catch doc comments that are silently attached to nothing.

Kotlin and Swift both bind a doc comment to the declaration that FOLLOWS it, and both
take only the LAST one when several are stacked. So a doc block can end up documenting
nothing at all while still reading correctly to a human scrolling past the file — the
text is right there, above the right function, in the right order. That is exactly why
this class of mistake survives review: nothing looks wrong.

It is caused by editing by INSERTION rather than in place — adding a new block above an
existing one, or dropping a new declaration into the gap between a comment and the thing
it documents. Both happened repeatedly in one day (#846 fixed three sites, one of which
had been introduced by #842 that same morning), which is why this exists.

Two patterns, both of which detach the FIRST block:

    /** Byte-parity twin of Swift `classifyCoverage`. */   <- becomes a dangling comment
    /** Both platforms use the NEGATED `>` form ... */     <- this one is the KDoc
    fun classifyCoverage(...)

    /** Persisted preferences file. */

    internal const val PREFS = "..."                       <- blank line detaches the doc

The cost is not cosmetic when the detached text is load-bearing. In #846 the block that
came adrift was a parity-contract statement, and the parity rule is the first thing in
CLAUDE.md — precisely the note you want attached to the function it constrains.

Pre-existing sites are grandfathered in Tools/doc_comment_lint_baseline.txt so the gate
starts green and blocks only NEW ones. It ratchets DOWN: fixing a baselined site prints an
IMPROVED line so the allowance can be lowered.

Usage:  python3 Tools/doc_comment_lint.py
Exit 0 when no file exceeds its allowance, 1 otherwise (with file:line for each).

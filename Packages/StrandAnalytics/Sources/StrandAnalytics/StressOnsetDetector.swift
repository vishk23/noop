// StressOnsetDetector.swift — the L3 closed-loop JITAI ("just-in-time adaptive intervention") detector.
// Generalises the math currently inline in `AppModel.evaluateStress()` into an EDGE-triggered,
// motion-gated, REPLAY-SAFE detector that decides — at the moment it matters — whether to offer a 60-s
// guided breathing cue. PURE + DB-free, carrying its OWN de-dup state exactly like
// `SedentaryDetector.evaluate`: the caller persists `nextState` and feeds it back, so a replayed window
// can't re-fire. No I/O / BLE here.
//
// See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-19-v5-haptic-biofeedback-design.md (L3).
//
// WHAT IT GENERALISES (from AppModel.evaluateStress): a rolling clean-R-R buffer → a SLOW RMSSD baseline
// (the shipped 0.98/0.02 EMA) + a resting-HR band gate (55–100 bpm) + a `rmssd < baseline × 0.6` drop +
// a once-per-15-min limiter + a single confirming buzz. What this engine ADDS, per spec:
//   1. A FAST short-window RMSSD (the latest beats) vs the slow baseline — "fast dropped below baseline".
//   2. EDGE trigger: fire ONCE on the fresh crossing (was-above → now-below), not every tick — and
//      only after that crossing has SUSTAINED for `sustainSeconds`, so a momentary RMSSD wobble
//      cannot nudge (a real stress response holds for minutes; see the constant's note).
//   3. The EXERCISE GATE (the credibility line): suppress when HR is out of the resting band AND/OR recent
//      motion says "metabolic, not stress" (gravity activity above a threshold, the same `recentGravity`
//      source `SedentaryDetector` reads). A brisk walk's HRV dip must NOT fire a "you're stressed" cue.
//   4. Rate-limit + quiet hours + master toggle, and never while a manual Breathe/L1/L2 session runs.
//
// HONEST / NON-CLINICAL: "stress" is an autonomic PROXY (HRV-down vs the user's OWN baseline), never a
// diagnosis. The card the caller shows says "HRV dipped while you were still" — never "you are stressed".
// On fire: a single confirming buzz + a passive in-app card; NEVER a push notification unless the user
// opted into notifications (matches DaytimeStress's "passive suggestion, never a notification" stance).
//
// All `ts`/`nowSec` are wall-clock unix SECONDS. Outputs are APPROXIMATE, not medical advice.

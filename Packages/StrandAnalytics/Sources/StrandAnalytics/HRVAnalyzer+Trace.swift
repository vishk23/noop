// HRVAnalyzer+Trace.swift - the HRV & Autonomic test-mode cleaning trace.
//
// Recomputes the cleaning-pipeline counts (range filter, Malik ectopic rejection, the minBeats gate,
// the spot rejected-fraction gate) from the SAME raw RR the analyzer reads, then reuses analyze(...)
// verbatim for the result so the trace can never disagree with the RMSSD/SDNN the screen shows. Pure
// and side-effect-free: no clock, no I/O, so a fixture beat series pins the exact lines. The HRV test
// mode gates this behind TestCentre.active(.hrv) at the call site (the spot reading); when the mode is
// off it is never called, so there is zero cost. No em-dashes. Counts and ms only, no PII.

extension HRVAnalyzer {

    /// Side-effect-free diagnostic twin of `analyze(rawRR:maxRejectedFraction:)`: returns the SAME
    /// HRVResult analyze(...) would, plus the cleaning trace. Reports nInput / nClean / rejected fraction,
    /// RMSSD / SDNN / meanNN, whether the `minBeats` gate cleared, the range + Malik ectopic rejection
    /// counts, and (when a ceiling is supplied) the spot rejected-fraction honesty gate. `path` tags the
    /// reading "spot" or "continuous" so a report shows which window produced it.
    ///
    /// The returned result IS `analyze(...)` verbatim, and every count is recomputed with the EXACT same
    /// filters (`rangeFilter` then `rejectEctopic`), so the trace and the headline can never diverge. The
    /// Kotlin twin is HrvAnalyzerTrace.analyzeTrace.
    ///
    /// - Parameter maxRejectedFraction: the SPOT-ONLY ceiling (#585). nil (the nightly/continuous default)
    ///   skips the rejected-fraction gate, exactly like `analyze(...)`.
    /// - Parameter path: "spot" for a live snapshot, "continuous" for the nightly windowed path.

// CaptureCompleteness.swift - the report-completeness guard (#812, generalised).
//
// #812 taught us that a Test Centre report can ship THIN: the mode was on, the user filled the
// questionnaire, but the killer trace for that domain never landed in the log (a dead emitter, a gate that
// never fired, an offload that produced only console frames). The report looked complete at submit time and
// only revealed itself as empty days later when a maintainer opened it. This guard makes that self-evident
// AT EXPORT: for every domain that was ACTIVE during the capture, it scans the redacted report text for that
// domain's expected key-trace token(s) and reports OK (token present, with a count) or INCOMPLETE (mode was
// on but produced no trace, naming the missing token). The result is written into report.txt as a "Capture
// check" section and into meta.json as a machine-readable `capture_check` field, so a thin report is obvious
// the moment it is assembled rather than after a round-trip.
//
// Everything here is PURE and side-effect-free: it takes the active-domain set and the already-redacted
// report text and returns values. No I/O, no clock, no PII (it only counts token occurrences). The token map
// is the single declarative source of truth shared by the report renderer and the meta field. No em-dashes.
// The Kotlin twin is CaptureCompleteness.kt, kept aligned by a parity test (same tokens, same status words).

/// Whether a domain that was active during the capture produced its killer trace.

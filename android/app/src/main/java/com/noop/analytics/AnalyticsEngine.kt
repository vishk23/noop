 * AnalyticsEngine.kt — orchestrator producing DailyMetric + sleep-session results.
 *
 * Faithful Kotlin port of StrandAnalytics/AnalyticsEngine.swift (verified on macOS).
 * Same algorithm, same constants, same thresholds; Kotlin-ized types, Double math.
 *
 * Given a day's raw streams + a user profile + personal baselines, it runs the
 * individual analyzers (SleepStager / RecoveryScorer / StrainScorer / WorkoutDetector
 * / Baselines) and assembles a [com.noop.data.DailyMetric] (Room cache shape) plus the
 * detected [DetectedSleep] sessions.
 *
 * This is a PURE function over its inputs — it does NOT touch the database
 * (persistence is wired by IntelligenceEngine). All derived values are APPROXIMATE.
 *
 * All `ts` / `start` / `end` are wall-clock unix SECONDS (Long); the Swift source
 * uses Int seconds.

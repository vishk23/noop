/// history into a single readiness read plus the drivers behind it. Everything here is a pure,
/// deterministic function of the rows you pass in — no networking, no strap commands, no state.
///
/// Signals and their references:
/// - **HRV readiness** — z-score of today's HRV against the personal trailing baseline. A drop of
///   roughly half a standard deviation flags autonomic fatigue (Plews et al. 2013; Buchheit 2014).
/// - **Resting-HR drift** — elevated resting HR vs baseline is a classic overtraining / illness
///   signal (Lamberts et al. 2004).
/// - **Respiratory-rate drift** — a rise in sleeping respiratory rate is an early illness signal.
/// - **Training Stress Balance (ACWR)** — acute (7-day) vs chronic (28-day) strain. The 0.8–1.3
///   band is the "sweet spot"; >1.5 is associated with higher injury risk (Gabbett 2016).
/// - **Training monotony** — mean/SD of daily strain over a week; high monotony (low variety) is
///   associated with higher strain and illness (Foster 1998).
///
/// Not medical advice. These are approximations from a consumer strap; they describe trends in
/// *your own* data, nothing more.

// CircadianEngine.swift — on-device body-clock phase estimate + a jet-lag / shift-work LIGHT & SLEEP-TIMING
// plan. Pure, deterministic, DB-free.
//
// INDEPENDENT implementation of published methods:
//   • Single-component COSINOR (Halberg's cosine fit) over the rest-activity rhythm — the standard
//     actigraphy method for estimating circadian phase (the acrophase = peak-activity clock time) and
//     amplitude. We fit M + A·cos(2π(t − φ)/24) by ordinary least squares on cos/sin regressors and
//     recover amplitude + phase. The accelerometer rest-activity rhythm is the primary phase signal; the
//     nightly skin-temperature minimum corroborates it (wrist skin temperature runs broadly ANTI-phase to
//     core temperature, and the core-body-temperature minimum, CBTmin, is the canonical phase marker
//     sitting ~2–3 h before habitual wake).
//   • Phase-response-curve (PRC) DIRECTION rule for the advisory: to ADVANCE the clock (eastward travel /
//     an earlier shift) → bright light in the morning, dim evenings, earlier sleep, stepped ~1 h/day; to
//     DELAY (westward / a later shift) → bright light in the evening, the reverse.
//
// WELLNESS / BEHAVIOURAL AWARENESS ONLY — APPROXIMATE. Light + sleep TIMING only. The engine NEVER
// prescribes melatonin or any supplement/drug, and never guarantees an outcome ("consider"/"aim for",
// never "you must"). Irregular schedules get an honest "your rhythm is hard to read right now."

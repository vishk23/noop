// ChargeDrivers.swift - the ordered "why is my Charge what it is" driver list.
//
// SHARED CONTRACT (engine <-> iOS UI <-> Android): the Charge (recovery) result gains an
// ordered list of drivers, one row per real term that fed the score. Each row carries the
// term's signed contribution to the score in POINTS, the measured value, the personal
// baseline it was compared against, and a short plain-English verdict. The UI renders one
// row per driver under the Charge ring; it never recomputes the score or invents a row.
//
// HONESTY RULES (non-negotiable, mirror RecoveryScorer.recovery exactly):
//   - A driver exists ONLY when its term actually fed the score. A missing / uncalibrated
//     input (nil HRV-baseline-not-usable, nil resp, nil sleepPerf, nil skin-temp deviation)
//     produces NO row, never a fabricated zero.
//   - deltaPoints is the term's REAL marginal contribution to the 0-100 score: the score
//     WITH every present term minus the score recomputed with THIS term omitted (and the
//     remaining weights renormalized, which is exactly what recovery(...) already does when
//     an input is nil). So the points come from the same weighting the headline uses, not an
//     invented number. A positive deltaPoints means the term pushed Charge UP vs leaving it
//     out; negative means it pulled Charge DOWN.
//   - The score is logistic, so per-term deltas do NOT sum to the headline; they are each an
//     honest "what this term was worth" marginal, ordered by magnitude (biggest mover first).
//
// Pure and side-effect-free: no clock, no I/O. The Kotlin twin is RecoveryScorer.chargeDrivers.
// No em-dashes.

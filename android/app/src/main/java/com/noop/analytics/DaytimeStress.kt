/*
 * DaytimeStress.kt — an intraday (hour-by-hour) read of the SAME autonomic stress proxy
 * the daily Stress monitor shows, computed from the day's banked HR + R-R.
 *
 * Faithful Kotlin port of StrandAnalytics/DaytimeStress.swift (verified on macOS).
 *
 * The daily Stress score (StressScreen / StressView) maps "resting HR up + HRV down vs a
 * personal baseline" onto a 0–3 logistic. This helper applies that SAME math at the
 * per-hour grain so the Stress screen can show *when* in the day stress ran high — not a
 * new score. For each waking hour it computes:
 *
 *   • mean HR over the hour                    (HR up   = stress, like daily RHR)
 *   • RMSSD over the hour's clean R-R          (HRV down = stress, like daily avgHRV)
 *
 * and z-scores each against the day's OWN quiet reference (the calm-hour quartile + the
 * spread across hours), then squashes the z-sum onto 0–3 with the identical logistic
 *   stress = 3 / (1 + e^(−raw)). 0 calm · 1.5 baseline · 3 high — same bands as the daily
 * score. The day is its own baseline: a desk day with one tense afternoon reads that
 * afternoon as elevated *relative to that person's own calm hours*, no cloud, no history
 * needed beyond the day itself.
 *
 * "Sustained high stress" is an honest, conservative flag: the most recent
 * [sustainedHours] covered hours must ALL sit in the HIGH band (≥ [highBandFloor]). It
 * drives a passive in-app suggestion to run a Breathe session — never a notification.
 *
 * APPROXIMATE and non-clinical: an hour with too little data (few HR samples / too few
 * clean beats) is reported with a null level and never invented.

/**
 * Pins the #982 give-up GAP fix. A WHOOP 4.0 that reaches STATE_CONNECTED and subscribes but never lands a
 * genuine bond can self-drop with status 0 at ~7s, BEFORE the escalating #971 bond watchdog fires. In that
 * case onBondWatchdog's recordBounce (which only counts its OWN localTerminate/0x16 bounce) never runs, and
 * the #617 loop detector skips it (never bonded, and status != GATT_CONN_TIMEOUT). Neither give-up counter
 * advanced, while STATE_CONNECTED zeroed the reconnect backoff every cycle — an unbounded connect/subscribe/
 * drop loop that drained the battery. [WhoopBleClient.shouldCountNeverBondedSelfDrop] is the pure gate that
 * feeds exactly (and only) that drop into the shared [BondWatchdogBackoff] give-up counter.
 *
 * The gate is deliberately narrow so a HEALTHY connect (didBond == true) and every other disconnect class is
 * untouched. Pure function -> no BLE seam needed, same shape as [BondWatchdogBackoffTest].

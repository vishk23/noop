# NOOP - Oura Ring BLE Protocol Specification (Clean-Room)

**Status:** Internal decoder foundation, v0.1 (2026-06-29)
**Scope:** Oura Ring Gen 3 (Horizon), Gen 4, Gen 5. Foundation for NOOP's own Swift (`StrandiOSShared` / `Strand`) and Kotlin decoders.
**Authorship:** This is NOOP's own original specification. Every protocol *fact* (UUID, opcode, byte layout, tag value) is cited to a reverse-engineering reference read for facts only. No source code was copied from any RE repo. NOOP decodes raw signals plus the ring's own HRV/sleep tags and runs NOOP's own scoring; NOOP never touches Oura's encrypted PyTorch scores.

**Citation keys used below:**
- **[open_ring]** - LogosIsLife/open_ring `PROTOCOL.md` (GPL-3.0; byte-for-byte verified vs ~953k records, Ring 4). Treat as the authoritative framing/layout source where repos conflict.
- **[ringverse]** - ringverse/protocol `oura/BLE.md`, `oura/events/EVENTS.md` (no-license; Ring 4 event-tag dictionary + layouts).
- **[open_oura-r3]** - Th0rgal/open_oura `docs/horizon-ring3-protocol-cheatsheet.md` (no-license; Ring 3).
- **[open_oura-r5]** - Th0rgal/open_oura `docs/ring-5-observations.md` (Ring 5).
- **[open_oura-feat]** - Th0rgal/open_oura `docs/ring-features.md` (feature gating).
- **[relue]** - relue/oura_ring_reverse `docs/.../heartbeat_replication_guide.md` and `heartbeat_complete_flow.md` (no-license; Ring 3 live-HR).
- **[oura-rs]** - Th0rgal/open_oura `crates/oura-protocol/src/events.rs` (no-license Rust clean-room decoder; facts cited only, no code copied). Its event tags marked `"_status": "unvalidated"` are treated the same as our Tier B - plausible, not ground-truth-confirmed.
- **[open_oura-act]** - Th0rgal/open_oura `crates/oura-cli/src/activity_model.rs` (no-license; facts cited only). The activity classifier's input assembly reads four SEPARATE event tags — `met`←`0x50`, motion←`0x47`, temp←`0x46`, `hr_bpm`←`0x80` — establishing which tag each signal comes from (notably HR from the `0x80` IBI record, not `0x50`).
- **[ring4-ble]** - Defying/oura-ring4-ble `docs/apk-findings.md` + `docs/protocol-notes.md` (no-license; APK static-analysis + Ring-4 BLE captures, facts cited only). Confirms the framing/auth/tag set is generation-invariant (Ring 4 == Ring 3) and pins the full feature-ID table + the feature mode / subscription enums; also confirms the app derives BPM as `round(60000 / ibi_ms)`.

> **CONFLICT NOTE (resolution rule):** The relue archive file `event_data_definition.md` describes events as **protobuf varint** records (e.g. `0x55` SLEEP_HR with field tags). This contradicts the **byte-for-byte verified TLV framing** in [open_ring] and [ringverse]. The TLV/bit-packed model from [open_ring]/[ringverse] is authoritative for our decoders; the protobuf description is treated as unverified/likely AI-fabricated and is NOT used. Where a layout is only attested by a single no-license, AI-generated doc, it is marked **(UNVERIFIED)** and our decoder must gate it behind a fixture test before trusting it.

## 1. GATT Layout

### 1.1 Base service (all generations)
- **Service UUID:** `98ED0001-A541-11E4-B6A0-0002A5D5C51B` [open_ring][ringverse][open_oura-r3]
- **Write characteristic (phone → ring):** `98ED0002-A541-11E4-B6A0-0002A5D5C51B`
  - ATT handle observed `0x0015`, **Write Without Response** (ATT op `0x12`) [open_ring][ringverse]
- **Notify characteristic (ring → phone):** `98ED0003-A541-11E4-B6A0-0002A5D5C51B`
  - ATT handle observed `0x0012`, notifications via Handle-Value-Notification (ATT op `0x1B`) [open_ring][ringverse]
- **GATT channel id:** `0x0004` [ringverse]

> Implementation note for NOOP: subscribe to `...0003` notifications, then write commands to `...0002` with `.withoutResponse`. Do **not** assume write-with-response.

### 1.2 Per-generation GATT differences

| Aspect | Gen 3 (Horizon) | Gen 4 | Gen 5 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Service `…0001` | yes | yes | yes (same layout) [open_oura-r5] |
| Write `…0002` | yes | yes | yes |
| Notify `…0003` | yes | yes | yes |
| Extra char `…0004` | - | - | **present**: read,write,notify,indicate [open_oura-r5] |
| Extra char `…0005` | - | - | **present**: write,notify [open_oura-r5] |
| Extra char `…0006` | - | - | **present**: write,notify [open_oura-r5] |
| MTU | 203 [open_oura-r3] | 247 [open_ring] | 247 [open_oura-r5] |

- Ring 5 keeps "the **same** GATT layout, framing, and app-auth flow as the Ring 3/4 … no new opcodes, event tags, or fundamental framing changes." [open_oura-r5]
- The functional roles of Ring-5 chars `…0004/0005/0006` are **unconfirmed** in the RE corpus - leave them unused in v1; do not write to them.

### 1.3 MTU negotiation
- Notifications stream up to the negotiated MTU (max payload = MTU − 3 ATT bytes). Default BlueZ MTU is 23 unless negotiated. [open_ring]
- **NOOP rule:** immediately after subscribing to `…0003`, request ATT MTU = **247** (Gen 4/5) or **203** (Gen 3). On iOS/CoreBluetooth the MTU is auto-negotiated; read `maximumWriteValueLength` and `CBPeripheral.maximumWriteValueLength(for: .withoutResponse)` and clamp writes. On Android, call `requestMtu(247)` before the first command.

---

## 2. Framing / Chunking

Two distinct layers ride on the same characteristics. The first byte disambiguates: a value present in the **opcode table (§4)** → outer command/response frame; otherwise → an inner event-record stream. [open_ring]

### 2.1 Outer frame (command + command-response)
All multi-byte integers are **little-endian**. [open_ring][ringverse]

```
+--------+--------+------------------------+
| op : 1 | len : 1| body : <len> bytes     |
+--------+--------+------------------------+
```
- `op` - opcode (§4)
- `len` - number of body bytes following
- Multiple outer frames may be packed into a single ATT notification value. **Consumer rule:** loop `consume(2 + len)` until the buffer is exhausted. [open_ring]

### 2.2 Extended / secure-session frame (opcode `0x2F`)
Opcode `0x2F` carries a sub-operation as the **first body byte**:
```
2F <len> <subop> <subop-body…>
```
Sub-op table in §4.2. [open_ring][open_oura-r3]

### 2.3 Inner event record (TLV) - the event stream
Returned during history fetch (`0x10`/`0x11`) and live streaming. Each record: [open_ring]
```
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+------------------+
| type:1 | len:1  | ctr_lo | ctr_hi | ses_lo | ses_hi | payload: len-4   |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+------------------+
```
- `type` - event tag (≥ `0x41`, §6) [ringverse]
- `len` - body length, **`len ≥ 4`** (covers the 4 timestamp bytes + payload) [open_ring]
- `ctr` (u16 LE) + `ses` (u16 LE) → **`ringTimestamp = (session << 16) | counter`** [open_ring]
- payload length = `len − 4`

> [ringverse]'s EVENTS.md states the header as `type:1, len:1, ringTimestamp:u32 LE` (i.e. it treats the 4 counter/session bytes as one u32). These are two equivalent views of the same 4 bytes; NOOP stores `ringTimestamp` as a single u32 LE and derives counter/session only if a generation needs the split. [open_ring][ringverse]

- **Total record length = `len + 2`.** [ringverse]
- Several records may pack into one notification; consume `2 + len` per record and loop. [open_ring]

### 2.4 Multi-packet payloads
There is no application-level fragmentation header beyond the TLV `len`. A record never spans two notifications in the verified corpus; each notification contains whole frames/records. NOOP's parser must still be defensive: buffer partial trailing bytes across notifications and only emit complete `2+len` records.

## 3. Authentication Handshake

### 3.1 Key materials (three independent layers) [open_ring]

| Layer | Size | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Link-layer LTK | 16 B | BLE bond / link encryption (managed by OS pairing) |
| LE Privacy IRK | 16 B | resolves the ring's rotating private address |
| Application `auth_key` | 16 B (AES-128) | the app-level challenge key (§3.2–3.4) |

- On a **factory-reset** ring, BLE link encryption (OS-level pairing/bond) is **mandatory** before any protocol command can be written. [open_oura-r3]
- The application auth handshake is **session-scoped**: it must be re-run on every new BLE connection. [open_ring][open_oura-r3]

### 3.2 Install our own key (opcode `0x24`) - post-factory-reset only
Used once after a factory reset to provision NOOP's own 16-byte AES key into the ring: [ringverse][open_oura-r3]
```
phone → ring:  24 10 <16-byte key>          (SetAuthKey; 0x10 = 16-byte len)
ring  → phone: 25 01 00                       (status 0x00 = OK)
```
NOOP stores its 16-byte key locally (Keychain on iOS, EncryptedSharedPreferences/Keystore on Android). This key is required for every subsequent session's challenge.

### 3.3 Get auth nonce (sub-op `0x01` → response `0x2C`)
```
phone → ring:  2f 01 2b                        (GetAuthNonce)
ring  → phone: 2f 10 2c <nonce: 15 bytes>      (18 B total)
```
[open_ring][ringverse][open_oura-r3]

### 3.4 Compute proof (AES-128-ECB challenge)
[open_ring][ringverse]
- Plaintext = `nonce (15 B) ‖ 0x01 (1 B)` = 16 B, then **PKCS#5/PKCS#7 full-block padding** appends `0x10 × 16` → 32 B total.
- Cipher = **AES-128/ECB/PKCS5Padding** with our 16-byte `auth_key`.
- **proof = first 16 bytes of the ciphertext.**

> Padding detail per [open_ring]: `AES_128_ECB(auth_key, nonce ‖ 0x01 ‖ pad)[:16]`. The trailing `0x01` byte and full-block `0x10` padding are load-bearing - the ring computes the same and compares the first block. Implement this exactly; do not strip padding before encrypt.

### 3.5 Submit proof (sub-op `0x11` → response `0x2E`)
```
phone → ring:  2f 11 2d <proof: 16 bytes>      (19 B total)
ring  → phone: 2f 02 2e <status>
```
[open_ring][ringverse][open_oura-r3]

**Status byte (`0x2E`):** [ringverse]
| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0x00` | Success |
| `0x01` | Authentication error (wrong key) |
| `0x02` | In factory reset (need `0x24` key install first) |
| `0x03` | Not the original onboarded device |

### 3.6 Pre-auth readable / gated commands
Before app-auth, the ring answers a small set unauthenticated: firmware (`0x08`), product serial/hardware (`0x18`). Auth-required commands return `2f 02 2f 01` until authenticated: battery (`0x0c`), history events (`0x10`), feature status (`0x2f…0x20`), realtime/feature-latest. [open_oura-r3][open_oura-r5]

### 4.3 Firmware response (`0x09`) decode

Gen 5 example `0912 020100 020103 010001 090329 665544332211`. [open_oura-r5]
**NOOP uses byte[2] of the API triplet (generation marker via product info) to branch decoder behaviour - see §7.**

---

## 5. Event Fetch (Cursor) Protocol + Live HR

### 5.1 GetEvents request (`0x10`)
```
10 09 <ringTimestamp:4 LE> <max_events:1> <flags:4 LE>
```
[open_ring][ringverse]
- `ringTimestamp` - cursor; ring streams records with `rt > cursor`. `0x00000000` = full dump. [open_ring]
- `max_events` - up to 255 records to fetch; `0x00` = ack-only (advance cursor without data). [open_ring]
- `flags` - phone sends `0xFFFFFFFF`. [open_ring][open_oura-r3]
- Canonical example: `10 09 00 00 00 00 08 ff ff ff ff` (cursor 0, max 8). [open_oura-r3]

### 5.2 GetEvents response / summary (`0x11`)
```
11 08 <events_received:1> <progress:1> <bytes_left:4 LE> <pad:2>
```
[open_oura `EventBatchSummary`]
- `events_received` - COUNT of events in the batch (`0xFF` = 255, the legacy max). NOT a status byte.
- `progress` - `sleepAnalysisProgress`, informational only (never a block).
- `bytes_left` - the ring's remaining buffered bytes; the drain is done at `bytes_left == 0`.
- The summary carries **no cursor**. An earlier revision read bytes 2–5 as `last_ring_timestamp` — that
  value is `bytes_left`, and persisting it as a cursor caused the #91 full re-dump loop.
- Observed on-device (2026-07-12): the `0x11` can arrive BEFORE its batch finishes streaming.

### 5.3 Canonical fetch loop (NOOP, aligned with open_oura `drain_events`)
1. SyncTime (§5.4). 2. Optionally `28 01 00` to flush flash-buffered events first. [open_ring]
3. Send `0x10` with the stored cursor, `max=255`, flags `FF FF FF FF` (open_oura's `flags=-1`).
4. Collect the batch until the stream goes QUIET (~1.5 s of no records — open_oura's `transact()`
   window). The `0x11` summary is NOT an end-of-batch marker (§5.2); never re-request mid-stream.
5. Next cursor = max envelope ring-time seen across ALL batch records + 1. If the batch had no records,
   or the cursor did not advance past the previous request's, STOP (open_oura `!progressed`).
6. Repeat from step 3 while the summary reports `bytes_left > 0`; done at `bytes_left == 0`.

**SUPERSEDED (open_ring):** an earlier revision taught an ack-fetch (`max=0`, cursor =
`last_ring_timestamp`) ~100 ms after the records. Re-sending `0x10` at a non-advancing cursor — and
especially mid-stream — makes the ring RESTART serving from that cursor: observed on-device 2026-07-12
as five identical ~955 KB re-serves of one window while the tail (`bytes_left` 409 KB) was never
reached. open_oura has no ack-fetch; every request is the same `(cursor, max=255, flags=-1)` shape
with the cursor advanced per batch.

### 5.4 SyncTime (`0x12`) and its response (`0x13`)
```
12 09 <unix_seconds:8 LE> <tz:1>
```
`unix_seconds` = host UTC as uint64 seconds; `tz` = signed offset in HALF-HOURS from UTC.
[ringverse BLE.md][open_oura `req_sync_time`] — validated on-device 2026-07-12 (this layout made the
ring emit its first 0x42 and anchored history).

Response:
```
13 05 <current_device_timestamp:4 LE> <status:1>
```
`current_device_timestamp` is the ring's OWN clock counter when it processed the SyncTime. [ringverse]
**NOOP anchor use (2026-07-13):** paired with the host wall-clock at receipt this is a DETERMINISTIC
ring-time→UTC anchor available at every connect. Needed because the `0x42` time_sync_ind record is
only logged when the ring actually ADJUSTS its clock — an already-synced ring can serve an entire
drain with no 0x42 (observed: a whole night parked unanchored). ringverse labels the field "seconds"
while the record clock runs in 100 ms ticks; NOOP disambiguates raw-ticks vs seconds×10 against the
persisted resume cursor (exactly one reading must land within cursor…cursor+7 days) and adopts
nothing when ambiguous.

**SUPERSEDED (open_ring):** `12 09 <token:1> <counter:3 LE> 00 00 00 00 f6` with
`counter = floor(unix_seconds/256)` and response `13 05 <ack> <counter_echo:3 LE> 00` — that request
layout never anchored on real hardware.

### 5.5 Ring-time → UTC anchoring
- The ring clock is in **ticks**: default **100 ms/tick** (10 Hz); burst mode **1 ms/tick** (`factor_flag=1`). [open_ring]
- Anchor from event `0x42` (time-sync ind, §6.11): set `anchor.utc_ms` from the event's epoch and `anchor.ring_time` from current `ringTimestamp`.
- Conversion: `utc_ms = anchor.utc_ms + factor × (target_rt − anchor.ring_time)`, `factor ∈ {100,1}`. [open_ring]
- On `0x41` (ring start) with `rt` regression → invalidate anchor (zero it). [open_ring]
- `0x85` RTC beacon gives 1-second-granularity `unix_s` as a secondary source. [open_ring]

### 5.6 Live-HR realtime enable (Gen 3 verified; same path Gen 4/5)
Three writes to `…0002`, each gated on its ACK; daytime-HR feature id = `0x02`: [relue][open_oura-r3]
```
1) 2f 02 20 02      → ACK 2f 06 21 02 01 11 02 00     (read DHR feature status)
2) 2f 03 22 02 03   → ACK 2f 03 23 02 00              (enable: byte0 = 3)
3) 2f 03 26 02 02   → ACK 2f 03 27 02 00              (subscribe: byte2 = 2)
```
**HR/IBI then streams ~1 Hz** as `0x2F` sub-op `0x28` push notifications: [relue][open_ring]
```
2f 0f 28 02 XX 02 00 00 <IBI_L> <IBI_H> 00 00 00 00 YY ZZ 7f
```
- IBI at body bytes 8–9: **`ibi_ms = ((byte9 & 0x0F) << 8) | byte8`** (12-bit, LE-ish nibble) [relue]
- **`bpm = round(60000 / ibi_ms)`** [relue]
- Example `[08,09] = 01 04` → `ibi = 1025 ms` → ≈ 59 BPM. [relue]

**Disable:** `2f 03 22 02 01` → ACK `2f 03 23 02 00`. Stream stops on ACK. [relue][open_oura-r3]

> Behaviour caveat: [open_oura-r3] reports that on its Ring-3 unit, realtime `0x06`-based enabling ACK'd but emitted no stream within 60–90 s, whereas the `0x2F`/feature-`0x02` path above produced ~1 Hz IBI. **NOOP must use the feature-`0x02` (`0x2F`) path, not `0x06`,** and treat absence of `0x28` pushes within ~10 s as "not streaming → retry/reseat."

### 5.7 DHR auto-revert
Daytime-HR auto-reverts after ~20 s; NOOP re-engages every ~15 s while a live session is open. [open_ring]

## 6. Event / Record Byte Layouts

All records share the §2.3 TLV header (`type`, `len`, 4-byte `ringTimestamp`). Body offsets below are **relative to the start of the record** (offset 6 = first body byte). All multi-byte values **little-endian** unless stated. [ringverse]

### 6.1 IBI + amplitude - `0x60` `ibi_and_amplitude_event` (18 B)
- Fixed 14-byte body (bytes 6–19) holding 6 IBIs + amplitudes, **byte-scatter packed** — each IBI is
  gathered from SCATTERED bytes, NOT a linear bitstream. [oura-rs][ringverse]
- **Shift exponent** = low nibble `[3:0]` of the last body byte (`b[13]`); if `n=7` then `shift=0`, else `shift=n+1`. [oura-rs]
- Each **IBI** (ms), for `k` in 0…5: `(b[6+k] & 1) | (b[k] << 3) | <2 high bits from the b[12]/b[13] nibbles>`
  — i.e. 1 LSB from an amplitude byte, 8 mid bits from `b[k]`, 2 high bits from the pack bytes. [oura-rs]
- Each **amplitude** = `(b[6+k] >> 1) << shift` (7-bit mantissa `[7:1]` shifted by the exponent). [oura-rs]
- Per-sample timestamp: walk backward from event UTC by each IBI duration. [ringverse]
- **WARNING (2026-07-12, ringverse ingest):** ringverse's `p_ibi_and_amplitude` shows the byte order
  is **SCRAMBLED** (each 11-bit IBI rebuilt from three non-adjacent pieces, exact indices in
  parse.js), while NOOP's `decodeIBIAmplitude` reads the fields with a naive SEQUENTIAL BitReader —
  the two do not agree, so our 0x60 IBI values are SUSPECT until cross-checked against concurrent
  live-HR R-R (same method as the 0x71 fixture plan). Part of the parked history-IBI work.

### 6.2 Green-LED IBI+amp - `0x71` `green_ibi_and_amp_event` (18 B)
Full layout per ringverse `p_green_ibi_and_amp` (parse.js, firmware `@0x503960`); payload = 14 body
bytes (indices below are payload offsets = spec offsets − 6). Strict length gate: wire len == 18.
- `p13` (spec byte 19): bit `[3]` RESERVED — set means a firmware-layout mismatch, do not decode;
  `s = p13 & 7`, `shift = (s == 7) ? 0 : s + 1`.
- 5 IBIs, each an **11-bit** value from three scrambled pieces (bit 0 | bits 2:1 | bits 10:3):
```
ibi0 = (p10 & 1) | (p4 << 3) | ((p13 >> 5) & 6)
ibi1 = (p9  & 1) | (p3 << 3) | ((p12 & 3) << 1)
ibi2 = (p8  & 1) | (p2 << 3) | ((p12 >> 1) & 6)
ibi3 = (p7  & 1) | (p1 << 3) | ((p12 >> 3) & 6)
ibi4 = (p6  & 1) | (p0 << 3) | ((p12 >> 5) & 6)
```
- 5 amplitudes: `amp[i] = (p[6+i] >> 1) << shift` (7-bit mantissa in bits `[7:1]` of `p6..p10`).
- Emission order: first entry is **amplitude-only** (`ibi = 0`, `amp[0]`), then 5 entries
  `{ibi[i], amp[i]}`; per-sample timestamps walk BACKWARD from the event UTC by each IBI (same
  model as 0x60). `p5`/`p11` unused. [ringverse]
- NOOP: `OuraDecoders.decodeGreenIBIAmpCandidate` implements this verbatim as a **Tier-B CANDIDATE**
  (#287) — used only in the 0x71 fixture-capture log, side by side with the raw bytes, until a real
  capture cross-checked against concurrent live-HR R-R validates it.
- CORRECTION: an earlier revision summarized this as "5 IBI deltas + 6 amplitudes" — the five values
  are full 11-bit IBIs (0–2047 ms) used as backward TIME deltas, and only 5 amplitude bytes exist
  (the first emitted entry reuses `amp[0]`).

### 6.3 SpO2 IBI+amp - `0x6E` `spo2_ibi_and_amplitude_event` (17 B)
- Byte 6: bits `[7:6]` = flag(1)+shift(3); bits `[3:0]` = mode(4). [ringverse]
- 5 IBIs as 8-bit counts ×8, read bytes 11→7 (reverse). [ringverse]
- 7 amplitudes: first `byte<<3`, rest `byte<<shift`. [ringverse]

### 6.4 Green IBI quality - `0x80` `green_ibi_quality_event` (4–18 B, 2 B/sample)
Per 2-byte sample, **high byte first** (NOT a little-endian u16): [oura-rs][ringverse]
```
ibi_ms  = (b1 & 0x07) | (b0 << 3)   ; 11-bit, b0 = high 8 bits, b1[2:0] = low 3 bits
quality = (b1 >> 3) & 0x03
flag    =  b1 >> 5
```
**NOOP filter:** accept sample only if `quality == 1` (the ring's "good beat" flag) and the IBI is
physiological (300–2000 ms). (Up to 7 samples per 14-byte record.) [oura-rs]
**Validated (decode fix):** the earlier reading treated the pair as a little-endian u16 masked to bits 0–10,
placing the high byte in the LOW bits — a bit-order error (real-capture within-record jitter 583 ms). The
high-byte-first layout with the `quality == 1` gate yields a clean beat train (45 ms jitter) and keeps more
good beats. Matches `open_oura`'s `parse_api_green_ibi_quality_event`. (Same class of fix as `0x60`, §6.1.)

**IBI → HR (NOOP research, Tier-B):** each accepted sample is a per-beat interval, so an instantaneous HR
follows as `60000 / IBI_ms`. open_oura feeds this record's per-minute HR (`hr_bpm`) into its activity
classifier (`oura-cli/src/activity_model.rs`, alongside `met`←`0x50`, motion←`0x47`, temp←`0x46`) — i.e. HR
comes from THIS record, not from the `0x50` MET record. NOOP already decodes these IBIs for HRV; a diagnostic
sidecar (`oura-ibihr-<id>.jsonl`, records tagged by source event `0x80`/`0x60`/`0x6E`/`0x44`) also
reconstructs an HR history from the banked stream for offline study — NEVER scored. **Result (2026-07-16,
first full overnight):** the earlier "sparse + ~15 % impossible-HR" daytime reading was largely the DECODE
BUG above (wrong bit layout), not a ring limitation. With the corrected layout, one full night decoded to
**94 % minute coverage, ~10 % beat-to-beat artifact, a clean ~56 bpm resting level with a real nocturnal dip
that tracks the reconstructed hypnogram** — i.e. usable as an overnight HR/HRV source. Daytime/activity is
sparser (~43 % coverage — wrist motion thins the banked beats) but the surviving beats are clean and HR
tracks effort (rest ≈ 59 → moderate ≈ 100 bpm). Still Tier-B, never scored; promotion to
`restingHr`/`avgHrv` is gated on multi-night validation against a reference. [open_oura-act]

**Caveats (2026-07-20):** two things bound "usable overnight HR". (a) It is CONDITIONAL on the ring being
worn — a night on the charger still banks a hypnogram + skin-temp but essentially no IBIs (the whole
banked window sits inside a `"chg. detected"`→`"chg. stopped"` interval, §6.15), so overnight HR exists
only on worn nights. (b) A banked IBI must be persisted at its OWN anchored ring-time
(`unixSeconds(forRingTimestamp:)`), never the drain-arrival wall-clock: because a night is drained the next
day, stamping the beat at arrival misfiles every overnight beat to the daytime sync moment — the deep-night
hours (00–06 local) come out empty while the sync hour piles up an implausible density. So the `oura-ibihr`
sidecar (anchored correctly) is right, but the datastore's `rrInterval` is not, until `.ibi` is anchored
like its sibling banked streams (`.hrv`/`.temp`/`.spo2`/`.sleepPhase`) — the fix in PR #677 (pending merge).

### 6.5 SpO2 per-sample - `0x6F` `spo2_event` (5–18 B, 1 s spacing)
- Byte 6: bits `[7:4]` = SpO2 base (<<7); bits `[3:0]` = status flag. [ringverse]
- One `uint8` SpO2 value per second from byte 7 onward; optional `0xFF` terminator. [ringverse]

### 6.6 SpO2 smoothed/stable - `0x70` `spo2_smoothed`/`spo2_stable` ; `0x7B` `spo2_stable_event` (6 B)
- `0x7B`: single **uint16 big-endian** at bytes 6–7. **(big-endian - exception to LE rule)** [ringverse]
- `0x70` present in tag dictionary as smoothed SpO2; layout **(UNVERIFIED)** - gate on fixtures. [ringverse]

### 6.7 SpO2 DC - `0x77` `spo2_dc_event` (variable)
- Byte 6: bit`[7]`=HDR low bit; bit`[6]`=`hasBase`; bits`[5:4]`=scale shift. [ringverse]
- If `hasBase`: bytes 7–9 = 24-bit LE base. [ringverse]
- Remaining: sign-magnitude int8 deltas; `v=(int8)raw; mag=|v|<<scale; out = v<0 ? -mag : mag`, accumulated. [ringverse]

### 6.8 Skin temperature
- **`0x46` `temp_event`** (10–18 B, even len): up to 7 samples, each **int16 LE ÷ 100 = °C**. [ringverse]
- **`0x69` `temp_period`** (6 B): single **int16 LE ÷ 100 = °C**. [ringverse]
- **`0x75` `sleep_temp_event`** (6–18 B, 30 s spacing): values **uint16 LE ÷ 100 = °C**, timestamps walk backward from event UTC. [ringverse]

### 6.9 HRV / RMSSD - `0x5D` `hrv_event` (6–16 B, 5-min spacing)
- Samples each with `time_ms` + two int8 fields (`b1`,`b2`); timestamps walk backward from event UTC. [ringverse]
- **NOOP note:** `0x5D` is the ring's own RMSSD-derived HRV tag; NOOP also reconstructs RMSSD/SDNN itself from the IBI streams (`0x60`/`0x80`) for our own scoring (we do not consume Oura's encrypted scores). [open_ring][ringverse]

### 6.10 Battery - `0x0D` response (8 B body)
- Layout: `percent, charging_progress, recommended_flag, 3 unknown bytes`. [open_oura-r3]
- Voltage as **uint16 LE at body offset [4..6]** per [open_ring]. **CONFLICT:** [open_oura-r3] reads percent at body[0]; [open_ring] reads voltage at [4]. **NOOP rule:** read percent at body[0]; derive a voltage-based estimate from [4..6] only as a fallback, fixture-validated per generation.

### 6.11 Time-sync ind - `0x42` (15 B)
- Bytes 6–13: an int64 LE epoch value; byte 14: int8 timezone offset in 30-min units (×1800 = seconds). [ringverse]
- **UNIT = unix SECONDS, not milliseconds.** [ringverse] documents this field as epoch milliseconds, but that citation is unverified and wrong: on real Gen 3 hardware the wire value is unix seconds. Treating it as milliseconds anchors every history-fetched sample to roughly Jan 1970 (about 1000x too early). **NOOP rule:** the decoder (`OuraDecoders.decodeTimeSync`) stays a faithful byte-level parse of the documented layout - `OuraTimeSync.epochMs` still names what the doc claims - but the driver multiplies the decoded value by 1000 before using it as the ms-scale UTC anchor (`OuraDriver`, the `.timeSync` ingest case). Treat this as a single-generation data point until a second ring/generation confirms it.
- **CRASH-SAFETY RULE: bounds-check any multi-byte wire arithmetic before use.** A full cursor-0 history dump (a ring never synced before) can surface a `0x42` record deep in the backlog whose raw epoch value is wildly implausible (near `Int64.max`) - a misaligned/corrupt record rather than a real time-sync (§2.4: "each notification contains whole frames/records" is the verified-corpus norm, not a guarantee). A naive seconds→ms `× 1000` on such a value overflows `Int64` and traps. **Any arithmetic on a raw multi-byte wire field must be plausibility-checked before use, never trusted as automatically well-formed.** NOOP's driver gates the time-sync / RTC-beacon anchor to a 2020–2035 unix-seconds window before converting (`OuraDriver.plausibleAnchorMs`), rejecting anything outside it as an undecodable record rather than crashing or anchoring to garbage.
- This is the primary UTC anchor (§5.5). [open_ring][ringverse]

### 6.12 Sleep architecture
- **`0x4B` / `0x4E` / `0x5A` `sleep_phase_details`** (≥19 B): byte6 = header; phase codes are **2-bit**, 4 per byte (bits `[7:6][5:4][3:2][1:0]`); codes **0=deep, 1=light, 2=rem, 3=awake** per open_oura's VALIDATED `decode_sleep_phases` (events.rs `PHASE = ["deep","light","rem","awake"]`). **CORRECTION:** an earlier revision of this line taught `0=awake, 1=light, 2=deep, 3=REM` from [ringverse] (unverified); live captures contradicted it (records decoded at wake carry code 3 = awake under open_oura's mapping), and both platform decoders inherited the bug from this exact text. [open_oura]
- **`0x6A` `sleep_period_info`** (14 B): bytes6–9 four int8 metrics; bytes10–11 `uint8/8.0`; byte12 motion-seconds uint8; byte13 sleep-state int8; bytes14–15 `uint16 LE / 65536`. [ringverse]
- **`0x72` `sleep_acm_period`** (16 B): values0–2 = `whole(8)+frac(8)/255`; values3–5 = `whole(4)+frac(12)/4095`. [ringverse]
- **`0x49` `sleep_summary_1`**: `start_offset_min` / `end_offset_min`, both uint16 LE **minutes
  before the event time** — the ring's tracked sleep window is
  `[event_utc − start_offset·60 s, event_utc − end_offset·60 s]`. [ringverse]
  **VALIDATED against NOOP captures 2026-07-12**: the `600/10` sample on the 7/11→12 night decodes
  to 23:30→09:20, matching the reconstructed 1196-code hypnogram (23:32→09:30 write-anchored) and
  the reported sleep (23:35–09:00). Earlier samples fit the same shape (688/101, 584/108, 716/164).
  Note the window END trails the SleepNet WRITE by `end_offset` minutes (10–43 min observed).
  **NOOP anchors the hypnogram burst end at `event − end_offset`** when a same-finalization 0x49
  (envelope ring-time within 10 min of the burst's) is present — the write-moment envelope shifted a
  whole reconstructed night +43 min on 2026-07-13 before this refinement; the 0x49 window matched the
  wearer's report within minutes (23:32→08:08 vs 23:34→08:03).
  **NOOP also clamps the burst START at `event − start_offset`** (2026-07-23): the SleepNet burst can
  write a few epochs BEFORE the 0x49 onset (7 min / 14 codes observed — reconstruct `22:48:58` vs the
  0x49 onset `22:55:58`), so the pre-window codes are clipped, symmetric with the end anchor. A clamp
  that would drop EVERY code (a mis-paired 0x49) is ignored, so it can never empty the night.
- **`0x76` `bedtime_period`**: start/end as uint32 LE ringTimestamps → map to UTC (§5.5). [ringverse]
- Tags `0x48,0x4A–0x4D,0x4F,0x57,0x58` are additional sleep summary/feature variants in the dictionary; layouts **(UNVERIFIED)** - decode only after fixtures. [ringverse]

**NOOP hypnogram reconstruction & persist (implementation).** The whole-night SleepNet phase codes
arrive as a BURST of `0x4E`/`0x5A` (and `0x4B`) records finalized after wake — all with near-identical
envelope ring-times (the WRITE moment, seconds apart), so arrival order is the code sequence, not a
sortable time. NOOP:
1. **Groups** consecutive phase records into one burst (envelope-gap grouping).
2. **Reconstructs the time axis** by laying the codes BACKWARD from the burst end at the 30 s SleepNet
   epoch: code *j* of *N* gets `ts = end − (N − j)·30 s` (each ts marks the start of its 30 s interval,
   the last interval ending exactly at the burst end).
3. **Refines BOTH ends with the paired `0x49` window** (closest envelope ring-time within 10 min): the
   END anchors to `event − end_offset·60 s` (the true sleep-end, ahead of the write moment) and the
   START clamps to `event − start_offset·60 s` (the onset), clipping the few pre-window codes. Both use
   only RING signals (the `0x49` window + the SleepNet codes); a clamp that would empty the night is
   ignored. The clip lives in the pure `OuraHypnogramBurst.codesWithTimes(…, sleepStartUnixSeconds:)`
   (unit-tested, both platforms).
4. **Anchors to UTC** via the session's `0x42`/`0x13` time-sync (§5.5); an unanchored burst is HELD
   until the anchor lands, never wall-clocked (the resume cursor only advances on an anchored persist).
5. **Persists** the anchored codes as a `CachedSleepSession` (`[{start,end,stage}]` breakdown) under the
   ring's OWN deviceId, so the imported-over-computed merge surfaces the ring's SleepNet staging as the
   night; the UI labels it **"Oura" / "raw on-device stages"**.

**FINDING — raw window vs the app's adjusted period.** The `0x49` window (hence NOOP's persisted window)
is the ring's RAW sleep window: it includes the edge AWAKE epochs (settling-in before sleep, lying awake
before rising). The Oura app / WHOOP display an ADJUSTED *sleep period* (first-asleep → last-asleep),
which is narrower — e.g. 2026-07-23: NOOP raw `22:56 → 08:21` (post start-clamp) vs a perceived/app
`~23:30 → 08:14`; the ~34 min onset gap is edge-awake the ring counts. This is the same raw-vs-adjusted
difference the "raw on-device stages" UI caveat surfaces.

**DESIGN DECISION — surface raw, do NOT NOOP-adjust.** NOOP persists the ring's window VERBATIM (only
reconciling the ring's own `0x49` window with its own SleepNet codes, above). It deliberately does NOT
trim the edge-awake to synthesize a "sleep period" — that would be NOOP post-processing the ring's
hypnogram, contradicting the ring-PROVIDED provenance and the "raw" label. If an adjusted/cleaned sleep
period is ever wanted, the consistent path is NOOP's OWN sleep staging from the raw signals (dense IBI
`0x60`/`0x80` + skin temp + motion), surfaced separately as an "On-device" computed night — never an
edit of the ring's tag.

### 6.13 Motion / activity
- **`0x47` `motion_events`** (variable): byte6 bits`[7:5]`=field_a, `[4:0]`=field_b; bytes7–9 = three **int8 × 8** axis magnitudes; optional bytes10–11. [ringverse]
- **`0x6B` `motion_period`** (19–31 B): 12-bit period `((b6<<8)|(b6>>6)) & 0xFFF`; byte6 bits`[5:4]`=leading-symbol count; then 2-bit codes, 4 per byte (MSB-first). MOTION_STATE enum: `0 NO_MOTION, 1 RESTLESS, 2 TOSSING, 3 ACTIVE`. [ringverse][open_ring]
- **`0x50` activity_info / `0x51`,`0x52` activity_summary**: activity category + intensity (MET-class). Layout **(UNVERIFIED - partial)**; [ringverse] notes real_steps/activity_info have unresolved constants. Gate on fixtures. [ringverse]
  - **`0x50` decode formula (PR #960 investigation, live Gen 3, 2026-07-02) [oura-rs]:** byte0 = a `state` code (activity-category, meaning unconfirmed); every following byte = one MET sample, `met = byte × 0.1` for `byte < 0x80`, else `met = 12.8 + (byte − 128) × 0.2` (two-slope: 0.1-MET resolution to 12.7, 0.2 steps above). **Plausible against six real Gen 3 captures** across two sessions - a full day from steady resting (0.9–1.1 MET) through a vigorous-activity burst (7.4 MET), everything physiologically sane, nothing negative or absurd - but **NOT ground-truth-validated** against the Oura app's own MET/step numbers. Stays Tier B: NOOP decodes it (`OuraDecoders.decodeActivityInfo` → `OuraEvent.activityInfo`, both platforms) but gates it behind `allowTierB`, logs it for investigation only, and never folds it into `OuraStreamMapping`/scoring - and NEVER derives a step count from it. `0x51`/`0x52` activity_summary stay fully undecoded (raw Tier-B bytes only).
  - **`0x50` MET cross-device validation (NOOP, 2026-07-15, live Gen 3):** the MET series TRACKS real activity
    intensity - three separate walks read mean ≈ 3.4–4.1 MET (p50 ≈ 4.4) against a sleep floor of ≈ 0.9 MET,
    and per-minute MET vs a Suunto `.fit` speed profile correlates **r = 0.89** (one walk, 13 min); the walk's
    Suunto Energy 196 kJ ≈ 47 kcal matched the recorded workout. It UNDERREADS water (swims read near-rest -
    optical/motion degraded). The stream is SPARSE with RING-SIDE cadence gaps (~86 % minute coverage on a
    choppy day; ~6–19 min holes that recur DURING an unbroken drain, so they are the ring's own logging
    cadence, not a decode drop) - so any daily active-minute total derived from it UNDERCOUNTS. This
    corroborates the "plausible, tracks activity" read while keeping it Tier B: still not a step count, still
    not ground-truth-validated against Oura's own numbers, still never scored. NOOP has no MET field in its
    HR/strain data model, so `0x50` remains a diagnostic JSONL corpus (`oura-activity-<id>.jsonl`); the ring's
    path into NOOP activity is HR (live push + banked IBI, §6.4), never MET. open_oura consumes this same
    `0x50` `met` as one input to its activity classifier (`activity_model.rs`). [open_oura-act]
  - **Real Steps (feature `0x0B`) server gating [open_oura-feat]:** real_steps is behind the server flag `activity/real_steps` (default **false**; `FeatureDefinitions.ActivityRealSteps`, Gen 3+), the same server-flag-off pattern as SpO2 (§7.1). This explains `0x7E`/`0x7F` never once appearing across the PR #960 live sessions - the ring isn't sending them, it is not a NOOP decode gap. `0x50` itself is an always-on base stream (not feature-gated), matching it appearing in every session.
- **`0x7E`/`0x7F` real_steps_features 1/2** (18 B each): bit-packed step features merged across the paired events. **(UNVERIFIED - partial)** [ringverse]

### 6.14 Raw PPG
- **`0x67` raw_ppg_summary** (12–13 B): start-UTC, type, scale, session header for following data. [ringverse]
- **`0x68` raw_ppg_data** (variable, delta-encoded): needs scale/accumulator from the paired `0x67`. [ringverse]
- **`0x81` cva_raw_ppg_data** (variable): delta + 24-bit absolute, session-stateful. Decode: byte `0x80` → next 3 bytes absolute u24; MSB-set byte → signed delta `b-0x100`; else signed 7-bit `+= b`. Reset on ring-reset ack or 60 s gap. [open_ring]

### 6.15 Lifecycle / state
- **`0x41` ring_start_ind** (18 B): bytes6–10 = 40-bit device id; bytes15–19 config; triggers anchor invalidation on rt regress. [ringverse][open_ring]
- **`0x43` debug_event**: ASCII text (state strings). [open_ring][open_oura-r3]
- **`0x45` state_change_ind / `0x53` wear_event**: byte6 = STATE_* enum; optional trailing UTF-8 string if payload>5. STATE enum: `0 unspecified,1 not_in_finger,2 finger_detection,3 user_active,4 user_in_rest,5 hr_user_active,6 hr_user_in_rest,7 out_of_power,8 charging,9 hibernate_low_power,20–22 production,30 hw_test`. [open_ring]
  - **NOOP wear/charge signal (2026-07-19, both platforms):** the numeric enum is unreliable in captured data — the byte reuses a value across meanings (observed: code 5 as both `"hr enable"` and `"motion det"`; code 3 as `"fea off"` and `"motion det"`) — so NOOP keys on the optional trailing STRING. `"chg. detected"` / `"chg. stopped"` bracket an on-charger interval. Combined with the live-HR push (a beat streams only from a finger → WORN) and a live-HR silence watchdog (stream quiet past a grace window → REMOVED), this drives the On-wrist / Off-wrist indicator. There is NO dedicated "worn" event — see `0x86` below.
- **`0x86` `aohr_event` (NOT observed in NOOP):** open_health's `unvalidated-events.md` documents a `0x86` aohr record that "appears when worn", but that decoder is confirmed by CODE (ported from `libringeventparser.so`), not data — it has **never appeared in a NOOP capture** (0 records across the corpus; the ring does not emit it in the NOOP-only, no-server-gated-daytime-HR configuration). Wear is inferred from the live-HR stream + the `0x45/0x53` charger strings above, never from `0x86`.
- **`0x85` rtc_beacon_ind** (10 B): `unix_s:u32 LE`, reserved 4 B, trailer u16 LE ∈ {`0x01F6`,`0x01F8`}. [open_ring]

| `0x04` | SpO2 | Gen3+; server-gated. **Confirmed OFF on a real Gen 3 ring** (2026-07-20 capture): the read-only `2f 02 20 04` feature-status probe NOOP ships (`spo2_status`, §7.4) decoded to `mode=0 status=0 state=0 subscription=0` - all-zero, i.e. the cloud never enabled SpO2 for that ring/account; it is not a NOOP decode issue. SpO2 also never arrives as a live push (unlike HR's feature `0x02`); it only ever arrives via history fetch (§5), same as skin temp. NOOP sends the diagnostic READ only; it does NOT enable/subscribe SpO2 (a live enable produces nothing during the day regardless). |

> **CORRECTION** [ring4-ble]: an earlier draft placed **Ambient light** at `0x10`; the APK enumerates `0x0F` = ambient_light and `0x10` = special_feature. The `0x0E`–`0x16` rows above are the APK's full feature list (22 features `0x00`–`0x12` + `0x16`).

**Feature modes** (write byte of `2f 03 22 <id> <mode>`): `0x00` off, `0x01` automatic, `0x02` requested, `0x03` connected_live. [ring4-ble] — an earlier draft read `0x03` as "requested-subscription" [ringverse]; the APK's `connected_live` is authoritative (it is the mode NOOP writes to enable the live-HR push, §5.6).
**Subscription modes** (write byte of `2f 03 26 <id> <sub>`): `0x00` off, `0x01` state, `0x02` latest, `0x04` feature_specific_data. [ring4-ble] — NOOP subscribes live HR with `0x02` = latest.
**Feature request-status** (result code of a `setFeatureMode` command): `0x00` success, `0x01` not_supported, `0x02` not_available, `0x03` not_in_finger, `0x04` message_too_short, `0x05` low_battery. [ring4-ble]
**Feature status/state values** (the `status`/`state` bytes of the `0x21` read reply, §7.4): `0x00` off, `0x01` on, `0x02` searching, `0x03` no-PPG, `0x04` cold, `0x05` movement, `0x06` identifying. [ringverse]
**Master gate:** `setFeatureMode` requires ring generation **> 2** (Gen 3+); Gen ≤2 reject all feature-mode changes. [open_oura-feat]

### 7.2 Generation differences

### 7.3 NOOP decoder build guidance
1. **Single TLV parser** (§2.3) for all generations - the framing is generation-invariant. Branch only on: MTU clamp (203 vs 247) and Gen-5 extra-char presence (ignore in v1).
2. **Generation detection:** read product info (`0x18 03 18 00 10`) → hardware id (e.g. `BLB_03`), and firmware (`0x08`). Map to Gen 3/4/5 to set MTU and pick verified-vs-unverified layout confidence.
3. **Trust tiers in the decoder:** Tier A (verified, ship now) = TLV framing, auth, GetEvents cursor, live-HR `0x02`, `0x60`/`0x80` IBI, `0x46`/`0x69`/`0x75` temp, `0x6F`/`0x7B` SpO2, `0x42` time-sync, `0x0D` battery, `0x45`/`0x53` state, `0x6B` motion. Tier B (UNVERIFIED, fixture-gate before use) = `0x49/0x4C/0x4F/0x57/0x58` sleep summaries, `0x50/0x51/0x52` activity-MET, `0x7E/0x7F` steps, `0x70` smoothed SpO2, the protobuf `0x55/0x59` interpretation (do **not** ship). (`0x4B` was reclassified out of the summaries — it is a Tier-A phase hypnogram, see §4.)
4. **HRV/sleep:** consume the ring's `0x5D` (HRV) and `0x4B/0x4E/0x5A` (2-bit phase codes; `0x4B/0x4E/0x5A => decode_sleep_phases` in open_oura) tags AND independently reconstruct from raw IBI/PPG for NOOP's own scoring. Never read Oura feature `0x06` (encrypted API).

### 7.4 Feature-status probe (read-only diagnostic)
NOOP ships a **read-only** probe that asks the ring to report a feature's own status, so an absent signal can be attributed to the server gate *from the ring's own mouth* rather than guessed. It sends the READ verb only — `2f 02 20 <id>` (sub-op `0x20`, the same verb as the live-HR `dhr_read` step, §5.6) — and **never** the `2f 03 22 <id> <mode>` set-mode/enable write. The `0x21` reply body decodes as five bytes: `feature, mode, status, state, subscription` (per §7.2 tables).

- **Shipped probes:** `spo2_status` (`2f 02 20 04`) and `realsteps_status` (`2f 02 20 0b`), sent once after `get_battery` on each connect; logged once per feature, never stored or scored.
- **All-zero = server-gated OFF.** A gated/unavailable feature reads back `mode=0 status=0 state=0 subscription=0`. Contrast the *streaming* daytime-HR (`0x02`), which reads `mode=1 status=0x11 state=2` — so **all-zero mode/status/state is the gated signature**, not `subscription==0` alone (daytime-HR is `subscription=0` yet active).
- **2026-07-20 Gen 3 capture:** both SpO2 (`0x04`) and real_steps (`0x0b`) returned all-zero — confirming §7.1 on live hardware. No local `setFeatureMode` can flip these; the gate is the Oura cloud `ClientConfiguration`, not the ring or NOOP.

## 8. Open Implementation Items (for the team)
- Confirm Ring-5 `…0004/0005/0006` roles before writing to them (currently unused).
- Resolve the `0x0D` battery percent-vs-voltage offset per generation via captured fixtures (§6.10).
- Validate all Tier-B sleep/activity/step layouts against real captures before enabling in scoring.
- Confirm live-HR `0x02` path on actual Gen-4/Gen-5 hardware (only Gen-3 is verified in the corpus).
- `0x68` and `0x86` are NOT emitted in the NOOP capture (0 of ~131k records) — do not hunt for them; wear inference uses `0x45/0x53` + live-HR (§6.15) and the `0x86` aohr never appears (§6.15).

## 9. Observed-but-undecoded tags (raw examples, NOOP Gen-3 corpus, 2026-07)

Tags that appear in the banked stream but NOOP does not decode. Payloads are the bytes AFTER the 6-byte
`type/len/rt` header, recorded verbatim for future RE — these are OBSERVATIONS, not confirmed layouts.

| tag | count | len (B) | example payload | shape hint (UNCONFIRMED) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x61` | 28760 | 3–8 | `1a18009c3700007c150000cb` | highest-rate tag; **NOT battery** — the `[open_oura-act]`-adjacent "`0x61` battery" label does not match here (non-percent, high-frequency) |
| `0x4a` | 8416 | 10 | `00000000000000000000` | payload observed all-zero — likely a keepalive / placeholder |
| `0x72` | 5723 | 12 | `120027000100150018000200` | six int16-LE small values — a vector (motion / accel?) |
| `0x6a` | 5689 | 10 | `7e00230b90140001f8b0` | mixed; a `0001f8b0` / `0001feb8` trailer recurs |
| `0x6d` | 3042 | 13 | `00c4ffffb5ffffd2ffffeaffff` | **`measurement_quality`** (24-bit signed) per [ring4-ble] — supersedes the earlier gravity/accel guess; our capture reads `00` + int16-LE-looking negatives |
| `0x6c` | 1750 | 4 | `02020400` | `02 NN 04 00` — small state / counter |
| `0x5b` | 416 | 10–13 | `030093dd10dbc7c00000` | variable, leading sub-type byte |
| `0x79` | 100 | 4–14 | `02000000` | `02` + an incrementing index (`00, 01, 02…`) |
| `0x76` | 8 | 8 | `4c876b00c0667000` | two u32-LE that look like ring-times — a window (start / end)? |
| `0x5c` | 6 | 4 | `284b02b0` | **constant** across every occurrence — a fixed marker / config |
| `0x56` | 1 | 1 | `01` | singleton |

Full-notification hex including the `type/len/rt` header is in the capture. For the highest-rate tags,
several full records are reproduced below (`type len rt(u32LE) | payload`) so a future RE pass sees the
record framing and cross-sample variation directly — a single stripped example once hid a truncated
prefix and tail fields. Note `0x61`'s payload length is **not fixed** (the `len` byte moves 0x10/0x11/0x12).

- `0x61` (highest-rate): `6110 ff756600 | 1a18009c3700007c150000cb` · `6111 00766600 | 23230000090000fd02003a0000` · `6112 f9766600 | 095b914700e9e00000fe81010005`
- `0x72` (`len` 0x10, 6×int16-LE): `7210 499b6b00 | 120027000100150018000200` · `7210 729c6b00 | 130029000100150018000200` · `7210 9c9d6b00 | 05000e000200160019000500`
- `0x6d` (`len` 0x11, leading `00` + 4×int16-LE negatives): `6d11 ec856600 | 00c4ffffb5ffffd2ffffeaffff` · `6d11 98976600 | 00b2fffffaffffeeffffd9ffff` · `6d11 419d6600 | 00a1fffffaffffd9fffff5ffff`
- `0x76`: `760c c2cf7100 | 4c876b00c0667000`

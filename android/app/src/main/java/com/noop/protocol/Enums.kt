 * On-wire enums for the WHOOP protocol. Each constant carries its raw (on-wire) Int value and

 * Values mirror the canonical schema (whoop_protocol.json) and the project SHARED CONTRACT.
 * These are deliberately a curated subset of the full device enum tables — only the codes the
 * offline companion app reads or sends. Unknown codes are surfaced by name elsewhere (see
 * [Framing.enumLabel]); they are not added here so the enums stay small and intentional.

 * identically on both platforms. Only 13 of these were listed before, so everything else rendered as a
 * bare `0x44(68)` in an Android strap log while iOS named it; #791 was filed partly on the strength of an
 * "uncatalogued" event that iOS already knew. That gap makes an Android bug report unable to say what the
 * strap is reporting — RTC_LOST, BOOT, BLE_SYSTEM_RESET and EXTENDED_BATTERY_INFORMATION all arrived
 * anonymous.
 *
 * Names only. Event PAYLOAD decoding stays exactly as it was: family-gated and deliberately conservative,
 * because several of these payloads have no on-device 5.0 ground truth and are left raw rather than ported
 * from 4.0 on faith (see `decodeWhoop5Event`). A name here does not imply a decoder.
 *
 * A number absent from the schema still falls through to `hexLabel`, and is NEVER given an invented name —
 * event 68 (`0x44`) observed on a real 4.0 in #791 is unknown to both platforms and stays unknown.

/**
 * Candidate reboot frames for the WHOOP 4.0 reboot probe (Test Centre → Connection, WHOOP 4.0 only).
 *
 * A real WHOOP 4.0 silently ignores NOOP's production reboot frame (opcode 29 REBOOT_STRAP, empty body
 * — #235: no reboot, no disconnect, no COMMAND_RESPONSE), and the correct 4.0 frame is unknown. These
 * are the plausible NON-DESTRUCTIVE candidates — a restart / power-cycle only, never a data-wiping
 * opcode — tried one at a time on real hardware so the strap log tells which one works: `reboot: link
 * dropped …` = the strap acted; `reboot: no disconnect within 12s …` = ignored.
 *
 * The definitive fix is still an HCI capture of the official app rebooting a 4.0 (exactly how the alarm
 * frame was pinned — @ujix's capture, #535). This probe is the interim way to find the frame when a 4.0
 * is in hand. Twin of Swift `RebootProbeVariant` (Commands.swift); the [logTag] strings are byte-identical
 * across platforms so a strap log reads the same either side.

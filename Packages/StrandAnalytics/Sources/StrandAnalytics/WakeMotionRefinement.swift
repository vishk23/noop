// WakeMotionRefinement.swift — motion-aware wake refinement (#364 "Proposal 2", a follow-up to the
// sleep-presentation work in #364; density-gate precedent from #345).
//
// THE PROBLEM. Both stagers (`SleepStager` V1, `SleepStagerV2`) call "wake" primarily from HR / HR
// variability — neither consults locomotion or posture. On a strap night with pharmacologically- or
// metabolically-elevated resting HR (a supplement protocol, a hot room, alcohol — anything that keeps HR
// up without the wearer actually getting up), that HR-led call misreads hot-but-asleep as wake. A real
// anonymized night (5.0 strap, elevated HR from a supplement protocol, not illness) scored 194 min wake
// across ~6.4h in bed (efficiency 0.50) though the wearer reported sleeping through. Minute-level review of
// the four largest wake blocks found ZERO walking cadence: each block was a single-minute turn-over burst
// (20-36 step-motion-counter ticks, a posture-variance spike) bracketed by minutes of complete stillness
// (posture variance < 0.01, zero ticks) — recurring on a ~90-min rhythm consistent with hot-but-atonic REM
// being scored as wake, not a real awakening. A genuine get-up looks entirely different: sustained
// multi-minute walking cadence, not an isolated single-minute blip.
//
// THE FIX. A POST-PASS over the already-staged `[StageSegment]` output of either stager (V1 or V2 — this
// file never touches their HR-led emission models). For each scored wake segment of at least
// `minWakeSegmentSeconds`, look at the SAME two signals a human reviewer used above: per-minute
// step-motion-counter cadence (`StepSample.counter`, wrap-aware, `activityClass` 1=walk/2=run only — see
// `walkClassTicksPerMinute`) and per-minute gravity posture variance (`postureVariance`). A segment with NO
// locomotion evidence (`hasNoLocomotion`) and posture stable outside a minority of isolated burst minutes
// (`isPostureStable`) is a hot-but-still wake call: every non-burst minute is reclassified to `light`,
// while burst minutes (plus a ±`burstPadMinutes` buffer) are KEPT as wake — the pass only ever shrinks
// wake time, it never invents wake the incumbent stager didn't already call.
//
// THE DENSITY SELF-GATE (#345). `SleepStagerV2`'s own header notes the WHOOP 4.0 gravity stream is often
// too sparse to tell "restless in bed" from "out of bed" — the same limitation applies here even harder,
// because a per-minute posture VARIANCE needs multiple samples inside each minute to mean anything (a
// single sample has zero variance by construction, which would silently read as "stable" and rubber-stamp
// every wake block on a sparse night). And a WHOOP 4.0 never emits `StepSample` at all — `steps` is
// permanently empty on that model, so a naive "zero ticks = no locomotion" read would ALWAYS pass. Rather
// than branch on strap family/model (which the maintainer flagged in #345 as too coarse — a "4.0" string
// tells you nothing about how dense THIS night's data actually is), `isMotionDense` measures the OBSERVED
// stream directly: at least `minDenseMinuteCoverageFraction` of the night's minutes must carry
// `>= minGravitySamplesPerMinuteForVariance` gravity samples AND `>= minStepSamplesPerMinuteForDensity`
// step records. A 4.0 night fails this on the data (empty steps, ~1 gravity vector/min) every time,
// exactly as a synthetically-sparse 5.0/MG night would; a real 5.0/MG night — which streams both channels
// densely — is this refinement's expected beneficiary and clears the gate on its own merits.
//
// SAFETY POSTURE. Default-off `Experimental` toggle (`PuffinExperiment.motionAwareWakeEnabled` /
// `Strand/Screens/SettingsView.swift`), consistent with CLAUDE.md's rule for a derived physiological
// signal: land it as an opt-in refinement, never the default, until it has more than this one reference
// night behind it. All thresholds below are NAMED CONSTANTS fixed a-priori from that reference night, not
// fit to labels. Pure, deterministic, no I/O — the Kotlin twin is `WakeMotionRefinement.kt`.

// MARK: - WHOOP 5.0 / MG "R22" feature-flag config (deep-stream unlock)
//
// WHOOP 5.0/MG straps withhold their deep biometric streams (the high-rate "R22" optical/HR/motion
// packets, type 0x2F) from a freshly-connected client. The official app switches them on by writing a
// short burst of persistent feature-flag config values right after the hello handshake — a sequence
// independently documented by two third parties:
//   • judes.club, "Cracking the WHOOP 5 Bluetooth Protocol" (decrypted HCI capture of the official app),
//     whose interactive frame-builder is the byte-level ground truth this file is validated against.
//   • Asherlc/dofek docs/whoop-ble-protocol.md (Android APK decompilation), corroborating the key names,
//     values and the SET_FF_VALUE (0x78) opcode.
//
// Each flag is ONE `SET_CONFIG` (0x78) command whose 40-byte payload is the flag NAME as ASCII, NUL-padded
// to 32 bytes, followed by a one-byte value (itself an ASCII digit: '1' = 0x31 or '2' = 0x32) at offset 32,
// then 7 bytes of zero. The command is built with the normal puffin envelope via `puffinCommandFrame`
// (cmd 0x78, the inner b3 byte 0x01 carried as the first payload byte, exactly like CLIENT_HELLO).
//
// This is reversible — it only changes which data the strap chooses to emit — but it is gated behind an
// explicit opt-in in the app, and on real hardware it can only be written from iOS/Android: macOS
// CoreBluetooth cannot complete the authenticated SMP bond the command characteristic requires.

// BiofeedbackController.swift — the live session controller for the three haptic-biofeedback layers
// (v5 "the strap that breathes you down"). It is the ONLY thing in the UI lane that walks the pure
// StrandAnalytics engines over time and fires the proven strap buzz path. The views (BreathingView's
// resonance + "Calm me" + stress-check-in surfaces) own *presentation*; this owns the *clock + the BLE
// send*, exactly the seam the spec asks for ("a DispatchQueue tick driving each BreathCue / the
// HapticClock asyncAfter pattern").
//
// See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-19-v5-haptic-biofeedback-design.md (Architecture & files → Wiring).
//
// Buzz path (reused verbatim, hardware-confirmed): `AppModel.buzz(loops:)` → `send(.runHapticsPattern,
// payload: [2, loops, 0, 0, 0])` — the SAME call the Haptic Clock (`buzzTimeNow`) and the inactivity
// nudge use. We only schedule WHEN to fire it; the buzz itself is the shipped one.
//
// All work is @MainActor (it touches AppModel + drives @Published UI state). Everything is opt-in,
// user-stoppable, quiet-hours-aware (the engines own quiet-hours), and bounded by the engines' safety
// envelopes (HRDownPacer's floor/ramp, ResonanceEngine's honest "no lock" fallback).

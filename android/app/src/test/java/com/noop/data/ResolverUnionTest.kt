/**
 * RESOLVER + SLEEP-BLOCK UNION (#1008, the #814 read-spine union joined to the two seams it missed):
 *
 * After a strap remove+re-add the Collector writes LIVE data under a fresh "whoop-<uuid>" id while the
 * WHOOP-export import + the engine's computed write target stay anchored on the CANONICAL
 * "my-whoop"/"my-whoop-noop". Two reads never joined the union model the rest of the repository uses:
 *
 *   1. [WhoopRepository.sourceCandidates] , the daily-metric resolver's strap-preferred candidate list
 *      was [strap, strap-noop, apple] with NO canonical fallback, so a caller threading the ACTIVE id
 *      orphaned the canonical history (and a caller passing the canonical default orphaned the live id).
 *      Fixed by appending the canonical pair, mirroring Swift Repository.sourceCandidates.
 *   2. [WhoopRepository.dedupSleepBlocks] , the union sleep reads ([WhoopRepository.sleepSessionsUnion] /
 *      habitualMidsleepSec) concatenate active + canonical blocks and must drop only EXACT-duplicate
 *      (startTs, endTs) twins, active copy surviving. Mirrors Swift Repository.dedupBlocks.
 *
 * These exercise the PURE companion seams only (no Room, plain JVM), complementing [ReadSpineUnionTest],
 * which covers the daily-metric union ids/merge. Stuck-sleep cluster: #1014 / #1009.

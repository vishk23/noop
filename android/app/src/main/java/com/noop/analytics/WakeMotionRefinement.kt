/**
 * WakeMotionRefinement.kt — motion-aware wake refinement (#364 "Proposal 2" follow-up; density-gate
 * precedent #345). Direct Kotlin port of the Swift `WakeMotionRefinement`
 * (Packages/StrandAnalytics/Sources/StrandAnalytics/WakeMotionRefinement.swift) — same constants, same
 * algorithm, same [StageSegment] shape.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM. Both stagers ([SleepStager] V1, [SleepStagerV2]) call "wake" primarily from HR / HR
 * variability — neither consults locomotion or posture. On a strap night with pharmacologically- or
 * metabolically-elevated resting HR (a supplement protocol, a hot room, alcohol — anything that keeps HR
 * up without the wearer actually getting up), that HR-led call misreads hot-but-asleep as wake. A real
 * anonymized night (5.0 strap, elevated HR from a supplement protocol, not illness) scored 194 min wake
 * across ~6.4h in bed (efficiency 0.50) though the wearer reported sleeping through. Minute-level review of
 * the four largest wake blocks found ZERO walking cadence: each block was a single-minute turn-over burst
 * (20-36 step-motion-counter ticks, a posture-variance spike) bracketed by minutes of complete stillness
 * (posture variance < 0.01, zero ticks) — recurring on a ~90-min rhythm consistent with hot-but-atonic REM
 * being scored as wake, not a real awakening. A genuine get-up looks entirely different: sustained
 * multi-minute walking cadence, not an isolated single-minute blip.
 *
 * THE FIX. A POST-PASS over the already-staged [StageSegment] output of either stager (V1 or V2 — this
 * file never touches their HR-led emission models). For each scored wake segment of at least
 * [MIN_WAKE_SEGMENT_SECONDS], look at the SAME two signals a human reviewer used above: per-minute
 * step-motion-counter cadence ([StepSample.counter], wrap-aware, `activityClass` 1=walk/2=run only — see
 * [walkClassTicksPerMinute]) and per-minute gravity posture variance ([postureVariance]). A segment with NO
 * locomotion evidence ([hasLocomotion]) and posture stable outside a minority of isolated burst minutes
 * ([stableBurstMinutes]) is a hot-but-still wake call: every non-burst minute is reclassified to `light`,
 * while burst minutes (plus a ±[BURST_PAD_MINUTES] buffer) are KEPT as wake — the pass only ever shrinks
 * wake time, it never invents wake the incumbent stager didn't already call.
 *
 * THE DENSITY SELF-GATE (#345). A per-minute posture VARIANCE needs multiple samples inside each minute to
 * mean anything (a single sample has zero variance by construction, which would silently read as "stable"
 * and rubber-stamp every wake block on a sparse night). And a WHOOP 4.0 never emits [StepSample] at all —
 * `steps` is permanently empty on that model, so a naive "zero ticks = no locomotion" read would ALWAYS
 * pass. Rather than branch on strap family/model (which the maintainer flagged in #345 as too coarse — a
 * "4.0" string tells you nothing about how dense THIS night's data actually is), [isMotionDense] measures
 * the OBSERVED stream directly: at least [MIN_DENSE_MINUTE_COVERAGE_FRACTION] of the night's minutes must
 * carry `>= MIN_GRAVITY_SAMPLES_PER_MINUTE_FOR_VARIANCE` gravity samples AND
 * `>= MIN_STEP_SAMPLES_PER_MINUTE_FOR_DENSITY` step records. A 4.0 night fails this on the data (empty
 * steps, ~1 gravity vector/min) every time, exactly as a synthetically-sparse 5.0/MG night would; a real
 * 5.0/MG night — which streams both channels densely — is this refinement's expected beneficiary and
 * clears the gate on its own merits.
 *
 * SAFETY POSTURE. Default-off Experimental toggle
 * ([com.noop.ble.PuffinExperiment.motionAwareWake]), consistent with the repo rule for a derived
 * physiological signal: land it as an opt-in refinement, never the default, until it has more than this
 * one reference night behind it. All thresholds below are NAMED CONSTANTS fixed a-priori from that
 * reference night, not fit to labels. Pure, deterministic, no I/O.

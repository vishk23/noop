/**
 * The safety-critical scheduler for the phone smart alarm (#207).
 *
 * DESIGN — fallback-first, the whole point of the feature:
 *
 *  • When the alarm is armed, we IMMEDIATELY schedule a GUARANTEED exact OS alarm at the LATEST edge
 *    of the wake window (target + window) using [AlarmManager.setAlarmClock]. That call is the most
 *    privileged exact-alarm primitive Android offers: it ignores Doze, survives the app being killed,
 *    shows the system's next-alarm affordance, and fires even in battery-saver. It is INDEPENDENT of
 *    Bluetooth, the strap, sleep detection, or the app process being alive.
 *
 *  • The overnight sleep watcher (in the BLE foreground service) may only ever call [advanceTo] to
 *    move the alarm EARLIER, never later, and only to a time still inside the window. It physically
 *    cannot cancel or skip the deadline: [advanceTo] re-schedules the SAME requestCode/PendingIntent,
 *    clamped to ≥ window-start and ≤ the original hard deadline. So if BLE drops, no light sleep is
 *    found, or the watcher never runs, the original deadline stands and the user is still woken.
 *
 *  • [cancel] is only reachable from an explicit user "disable" or after the alarm has fired — never
 *    from the detection path.
 *
 * The single PendingIntent targets [SmartAlarmReceiver], which raises a full-screen high-priority
 * alarm notification with sound + vibration. Everything is on-device.

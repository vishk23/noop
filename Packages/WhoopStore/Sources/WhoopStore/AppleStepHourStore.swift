// MARK: - v27 store: hourly Apple Health step counts
// Mirrors OuraRawStore: an idempotent ON CONFLICT upsert keyed by the natural key (deviceId, ts), and
// a range read — all GRDB work via syncWrite/syncRead. `appleDaily.steps` already answers "how many
// steps that day"; this table answers "which HOURS were recorded", so the UI can show retroactively
// when the iPhone was off/dead/left behind (e.g. mid-hike) instead of a single flattened daily total.

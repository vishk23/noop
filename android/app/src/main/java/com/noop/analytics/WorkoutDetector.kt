/*
 * WorkoutDetector.kt — retroactive workout detection from the 1 Hz store.
 *
 * Faithful Kotlin port of StrandAnalytics/WorkoutDetector.swift (verified on macOS),
 * itself ported from server/ingest/app/analysis/exercise.py (+ activity.py, calories.py).
 *
 * A workout is a SUSTAINED window (≥ MIN_EXERCISE_MIN) of elevated HR (above
 * resting + HR_MARGIN_BPM) AND sustained motion (gravity-derived intensity above
 * MOTION_THRESHOLD). Both gates must hold for a sample to count as active.
 *
 * Per detected bout: avg/peak HR, duration, Edwards zone time-%, mean %HRR,
 * strain (StrainScorer), and estimated calories (Keytel 2005 active + revised
 * Harris–Benedict BMR resting, age/sex/weight/height adjusted).
 *
 * All intensity/energy outputs are APPROXIMATE and not medical advice.
 *
 * Types note: [UserProfile], [ExerciseSession] and [ActivityPoint] live in
 * AnalyticsModels.kt (shared value types) and are NOT redefined here. Inputs are
 * the Room entities com.noop.data.HrSample (ts:Long seconds, bpm:Int) and
 * com.noop.data.GravitySample (ts:Long seconds, x/y/z:Double). All `ts`/`start`/`end`
 * are unix SECONDS as Long. The Swift source used Int seconds.

     * - The negative tie. Swift's .rounded() is half-AWAY-from-zero and Java's Math.round is
     *   half-UP, so they disagree on -4.5 (-5 vs -4). Rounding abs(v) and re-applying the sign makes the
     *   two identical in both directions; it also keeps the minus sign, which integer / and % truncating
     *   toward zero would otherwise drop (-0.4 printing as 0.4).
     * - The trap. Swift's Int(_: Double) CRASHES on a finite value past Int.max while Kotlin's
     *   Math.round silently saturates to Long.MAX_VALUE. Today's caller can't produce one (the detector
     *   gates maxHR > restingHR before computing %HRR), but this is public API, and a diagnostic that kills
     *   the process is the worst possible way for one to fail. Past the bound both platforms print nil,

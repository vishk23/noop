# Changelog

All notable changes to NOOP. NOOP is an independent, experimental project — not the WHOOP app, and
not affiliated with WHOOP. It reads a strap you own, on your own device, fully offline. Dates are
approximate; downloads are on the [Releases](https://github.com/NoopApp/noop/releases) page.

## What to expect

- **Independent, and experimental.** Treat NOOP as a capable work-in-progress rather than a finished
  product.
- **WHOOP 4.0 is the supported path.** It is tested and works end to end. WHOOP 5.0/MG is newer: live
  heart rate works today, but deeper metrics (recovery, strain, sleep) for 5/MG are still being
  figured out. NOOP always tells you what's live versus still building.
- **Your scores build over a few nights.** Live heart rate is instant; recovery, strain and sleep
  sharpen as NOOP learns your baseline. Import your WHOOP export to backfill your history instantly.
- **Everything stays on your device.** No account, no cloud, no sync.

## 1.13 — WHOOP 5/MG heart rate on Android

- **Fixed (Android, WHOOP 5/MG): bonded but no heart rate.** Android brought the strap to "Bonded —
  Streaming" (v1.10) but then listened for HR only on the standard `0x2A37` profile — which a 5/MG
  strap doesn't stream. Realtime HR rides the puffin notify chars (`fd4b0003/4/5/7`) as `REALTIME_DATA`,
  exactly as on macOS. NOOP now, on the `.whoop5` path only: (1) subscribes those puffin notify chars
  **after** the `CLIENT_HELLO` bond (they're rejected on an unauthenticated link); (2) makes the frame
  reassembler **family-aware** (5/MG framing is `declLen @[2..4]` / total `+8`, vs WHOOP4 `length @[1..3]`
  / `+4` — the WHOOP4 rule decoded a bogus ~6 KB length and never emitted a frame); (3) decodes `REALTIME_DATA`
  at the WHOOP5 `+4` offsets (HR @16) — the same hardware-verified decode shipped for macOS in PR #21; and
  (4) sends the realtime-HR toggle with **puffin command framing** (`send()` dropped every 5/MG command
  before). Verified by unit tests against a real worn-strap frame (HR=98, R-R=[603,587]); the new decode +
  reassembler are covered. Still experimental on 5/MG; WHOOP 4.0 is byte-for-byte unaffected (issue #17/#26).
- **Note:** other 5/MG commands (battery poll, haptic buzz) still need their own verified puffin framing
  and remain dropped for now — only the realtime-HR toggle is wired, because it's the one confirmed on
  hardware. So buzz on a 5/MG strap isn't expected to fire yet (issue #28).

## 1.12 — WHOOP 5/MG heart rate on Mac + Readiness anchoring

- **Fixed (macOS, WHOOP 5/MG): the connect bonding and actually streaming live HR.** The v1.5 attempt
  bonded but still failed on real 5/MG hardware because it subscribed the protected puffin notify chars
  (`fd4b0003/4/5/7`) at *discovery*, before the link was encrypted — the strap rejected them with
  *"Authentication is insufficient"* and the bond write itself failed *"Encryption is insufficient."*
  NOOP now (1) retains those chars but defers the subscribe until the `CLIENT_HELLO` `.withResponse`
  write confirms in `didWriteValueFor`; (2) arms realtime HR post-bond with **puffin command framing**
  (`puffinCommandFrame(TOGGLE_REALTIME_HR)`) — the `send()` guard previously dropped every 5/MG command,
  so even a bonded strap never started streaming; and (3) surfaces actionable pairing-mode guidance when
  the bond is refused (`Encryption/Authentication is insufficient`) — CoreBluetooth won't start a fresh
  just-works bond against a strap still bonded to the official WHOOP app, so it must be in pairing mode
  (blue LEDs, WHOOP app closed). Reimplemented from a 5/MG owner's hardware-verified flow (issue #17).
  WHOOP 4.0 is untouched; the change is scoped entirely to the `.whoop5` path.
- **Fixed (Mac + Android): the Readiness card still anchoring to the newest stored row.** v1.11 anchored
  Today, the sparklines and the Trends windows to the device's real calendar day, but left
  `ReadinessEngine` reading `sorted.last`, so the "Should you push today?" card still synthesised off a
  stale import's newest day. Both platforms now pass the local day key into `evaluate(...)`, and the
  engine treats an explicit-but-absent `today` as *insufficient* rather than falling back to the newest
  row — so on a stale import the readiness card hides instead of showing an old day's read. No-op for
  anyone wearing the strap nightly (today's row exists). Caught via @Brechard's PR #24 (issue #23/#24).

---

## 1.11 — Today reflects today, not stale imports

- **Fixed (Mac + Android): the dashboard treated the newest *imported* day as "today."** After a
  historical WHOOP import, the Today hero, the 14-day sparklines and the Trends W/M/3M windows were all
  anchored to the newest stored *row* (or `latestDay`) rather than the device's actual calendar date —
  so a months-old import showed as today's recovery/readiness, and the trend windows showed the last N
  imported days instead of the last N calendar days. Today now resolves by the real local day key
  (`yyyy-MM-dd`), and the sparkline/Trends windows are date-anchored to today; older imports stay
  visible under the wider ranges / All history. No change for the common case (recent contiguous data:
  last-N-days == last-N-rows) — only stale-import dashboards are corrected (issue #23).

## 1.10 — WHOOP 5/MG bonding on Android + Health Monitor fix

- **Fixed (Android, WHOOP 5/MG): the strap connecting but never bonding.** It wrote `CLIENT_HELLO`
  unacknowledged (`WRITE_TYPE_NO_RESPONSE`), which never triggered the just-works bond the `fd4b` strap
  needs — so it sat connected, unbonded, and silent (the strap won't even stream the standard `0x2A37`
  HR on an unauthenticated link). `CLIENT_HELLO` is now a confirmed write that triggers bonding (the
  same fix shipped for macOS in v1.5), so live HR can come through. Experimental; isolated to the 5/MG
  path — WHOOP 4.0 unaffected (issue #17).
- **Fixed (Health Monitor): the heart-rate chart freezing when opened from the Live page.** Leaving
  Live sent `TOGGLE_REALTIME_HR=0`, switching the stream off, so Health Monitor (which also shows live
  HR) got nothing. The realtime stream is now ref-counted and stays on while any live-HR screen is
  visible (issue #18).

---

## 1.9 — Fix: bonded but no live data (Android)

- **Fixed (Android): a strap that connects and bonds but shows no live data** — heart rate, battery,
  worn and events all blank (it reproduces reliably on newer Android). A GATT callback-threading race
  let the bond's with-response write fire before the notification subscriptions and starve them as
  BUSY, so the strap looked bonded (commands like buzz worked) but not one notification was ever
  enabled. NOOP now pins all GATT callbacks to the main looper (API 28+) and retries a transiently-BUSY
  subscribe. Reported, diagnosed and hardware-verified (Pixel 8 / Android 16) by a community
  contributor (PR #22); reviewed for no regression to the verified WHOOP 4.0 path.

---

## 1.8 — Strap-log export on Mac + a Health Monitor fix

- **New (Mac): export the strap log.** The Live screen's strap-log card now has **Copy** and **Save…**
  buttons, so Mac users can attach the connection log to a bug report — Android has had this since 1.6,
  Mac didn't (issue #17).
- **Fixed: Health Monitor heart-rate chart flat-lining.** It derived the chart from R-R intervals,
  which are sparse on WHOOP 4.0, so it sat on a flat 2-point line even while HR was clearly changing.
  It now plots a rolling buffer of your live heart rate over time (issue #18).

---

## 1.7 — WHOOP 5/MG frame capture + protocol workbench

- **New (Mac): opt-in WHOOP 5/MG frame capture.** Settings → Experimental → "Record puffin frames"
  logs the strap's raw 5/MG ("puffin") frames — each stamped with a timestamp and your live heart
  rate as ground-truth — to a JSON file, with Export / Reveal actions. Read-only on the strap, off by
  default, and never touches WHOOP 4.0. This is how 5/MG owners can contribute the captures needed to
  decode recovery / strain / sleep.
- **Dev tooling:** a headless Linux capture workbench (`tools/linux-capture/`, Python + bleak) and a
  `whoop-decode` CLI that decodes captures with the same `WhoopProtocol` decoder the apps ship — no
  second decoder to drift. Plus hardware-verified WHOOP 5.0 bonding/session notes in
  `docs/BLE_REVERSE_ENGINEERING.md` that confirm the v1.5 just-works-bond approach.
- Cherry-picked from community PRs #19 and #20 by @j0b-dev — reviewed, build-verified, and
  reimplemented for the repo.

---

## 1.6 — Share strap logs, and a worn-status fix

- **New (Android): Share strap log.** Settings → Strap → **"Share strap log"** writes the connection
  log to a file and opens the share sheet, so you can attach it to a bug report. Android's logs
  weren't reachable without `adb`, which is why connection problems on Android (issues #17, #18) were
  hard to diagnose — now they're one tap away.
- **Fixed (Android): the "Worn" status always reading Off.** The Android default was wrong (`false`);
  it now defaults to worn until the strap reports otherwise, matching the macOS app (issue #18).
- **Mac:** the alarm debug log now prints your **local** wake time instead of UTC. Alarms already
  fired at the correct local time — the log's "+0000" was just `Date`'s default UTC formatting.

---

## 1.5 — WHOOP 5/MG: secure-pairing fix

- **Fixed (experimental): WHOOP 5.0/MG stuck at "Finishing the secure pairing handshake."** The 5/MG
  strap requires an encrypted (bonded) Bluetooth link before it will let the app subscribe to its
  characteristics — it was rejecting them with "Authentication is insufficient," so the handshake
  waited forever and live heart rate never arrived. NOOP now writes the `CLIENT_HELLO` with-response
  to trigger just-works bonding, then subscribes once the link is authenticated. Diagnosed from a
  shared strap log by a contributor on issue #17. **Still experimental on 5/MG** — if you have one,
  please try it and share your strap log so we can keep improving it. WHOOP 4.0 is unaffected.

---

## 1.4 — Live heart rate that doesn't freeze

- **Fixed: live heart rate freezing mid-session.** The WHOOP firmware lets its realtime stream lapse
  if it isn't periodically re-armed, which left heart rate stuck on a stale number while the strap was
  still "connected" — the only fix was a manual disconnect/reconnect. NOOP now runs a 30-second
  keep-alive that re-arms the realtime stream, re-subscribes a dropped notification, and — if nothing
  has arrived for two minutes — reconnects on its own. This ports the macOS app's existing keep-alive
  to Android, so the two platforms behave the same.
- **Fixed: a corrupt Bluetooth packet could wedge the live stream.** The frame reader now rejects an
  impossible frame length and resyncs to the next packet, and starts each connection from a clean
  buffer, so a single bad packet can't freeze the stream until you reconnect.

---

## 1.3 — Stays connected in the background

- **New: keeps your strap connected when the app is closed.** On Android, NOOP runs a quiet ongoing
  foreground-service notification that holds the Bluetooth link open, so your heart rate keeps
  streaming and offloads keep landing even after you swipe the app away. On macOS this already came
  for free — close the window and NOOP keeps running from the menu bar.
- **New: "Keep connected in the background" toggle** in Settings → Strap, on by default. Turn it off
  and NOOP disconnects whenever you close the app (and drops the notification with it).
- **Fixed:** the strap dropping the instant you closed the app (the connection used to be torn down
  with the screen). The BLE client is now owned by the app process, not the UI.
- **Fixed:** the Android notification permission is now actually declared and requested, so the
  background notification can appear on Android 13+.

---

## 1.2 — Readiness, and the start of WHOOP 5/MG

- **New: Readiness.** A "should you push today?" card on Today that synthesizes established
  sports-science signals from your own history — HRV vs your baseline (Plews/Buchheit), resting-heart-
  rate drift (Lamberts), sleeping respiratory rate, training-load balance (the acute:chronic workload
  ratio, Gabbett) and training variety (monotony, Foster) — into one headline (Primed / Balanced /
  Strained / Run down) with the drivers beneath it. Pure on-device math; not medical advice.
- **WHOOP 5/MG: live heart rate now works.** Deeper 5/MG metrics (recovery, strain, sleep) are still
  experimental and being worked on.
- **Opt-in WHOOP 5/MG protocol probes** under Settings → Experimental, for 5/MG owners who want to
  help map the protocol. Off by default; never affects WHOOP 4.0.
- **Localized exports import fully.** German (and other localized) WHOOP exports now import with real
  values, not blanks — the column headers are mapped, not just the filenames.
- **Fixes.** The WHOOP 5/MG "stuck connecting" state, and the macOS "Choose export" button.

## 1.1 — Scores live from the strap

- **On-device scoring.** Recovery, strain and sleep now compute live from the strap, not only from an
  import. They calibrate over your first few nights, like any recovery wearable.
- **Pick your strap** (WHOOP 4.0 or 5.0/MG) before connecting, so it looks for the right one.
- **Universal macOS build** that runs on both Intel and Apple Silicon.

## 1.0 — First release

- Pair directly with a WHOOP strap over Bluetooth — no WHOOP account, no cloud.
- Compute recovery, strain, HRV and sleep locally on your own device.
- Bring your history: import a WHOOP export, an Apple Health export, or Android Health Connect.

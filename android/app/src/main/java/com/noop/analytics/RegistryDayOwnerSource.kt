/**
 * [IntelligenceEngine.DayOwnerSource] backed by the [DeviceRegistry] (Phase 1B-4). Supplies the engine
 * with the per-day owner-resolution inputs so a day is scored from exactly ONE device (invariant I2),
 * without giving the pure-JVM engine a Room dependency.
 *
 * Priorities mirror the Swift IntelligenceEngine.resolveDayOwner exactly:
 *   0 = the active strap, 1 = other live (BLE/historyBLE) straps, 2 = imports (cloud/file). Lower wins.
 * Archived devices are excluded. With only the seeded active 'my-whoop' row paired (the default and
 * every single-WHOOP install), the sole candidate is priority 0, so the engine resolves to "my-whoop"
 * for every day and the reads stay byte-identical to the single-source path.

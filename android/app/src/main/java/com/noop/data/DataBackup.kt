/**
 * Whole-store EXPORT / IMPORT for device migration.
 *
 * NOOP keeps everything on-device in a single Room/SQLite file ([WhoopDatabase.DB_NAME]).
 * Moving to a new phone therefore means moving exactly that one file. There is no cloud,
 * no account, nothing leaves the device except through these two explicit, user-driven
 * file operations (a SAF document the user picks).
 *
 * Export: checkpoint the WAL into the main db file, then write a ZIP (the `.noopbak`
 * format) containing the SQLite file plus a small `settings.json` entry (#1000) with the
 * whitelisted profile/display settings (see [BackupSettingsCodec]), so a restore also
 * brings back weight/height/units and not just the rows. ZIP deflate typically reduces a
 * 100 MB+ SQLite backup to 10–20 MB — SQLite's page-aligned text data compresses very
 * well. The ZIP is a standard container: users can rename `.noopbak` → `.zip` and
 * extract the SQLite manually with any archive tool on any OS.
 *
 * Import: detect whether the picked file is a `.noopbak` ZIP (PK magic) or a legacy
 * plain `.sqlite` / `.noopdb` (SQLite magic) and handle both, so old backups keep
 * working. Validates the extracted/direct SQLite header, the backup's origin, AND its
 * structural integrity (`PRAGMA quick_check`, #1014) before touching the live DB.
 * Closes the live Room singleton, snapshots the current db, overwrites it with the
 * chosen one, drops the stale `-wal` / `-shm` sidecars, then re-verifies the landed
 * file and rolls back to the snapshot automatically if the copy tore (#1014). The
 * caller then instructs the user to restart the app so Room re-opens the new file fresh.

/**
 * #1014 defence-in-depth: a Room open-helper factory whose ONLY behavioural change is corruption
 * handling. The platform DEFAULT — androidx.sqlite routes SQLITE_CORRUPT to
 * [SupportSQLiteOpenHelper.Callback.onCorruption], whose base implementation mirrors Android's
 * `DefaultDatabaseErrorHandler` — silently DELETES the corrupt database file. For NOOP that means
 * permanently destroying already-acked strap history the strap will never re-send, without the user
 * ever seeing a byte of it. Confirmed absent in this app before #1014: nothing overrode
 * onCorruption, so the delete-on-corruption default applied.
 *
 * The factory wraps the stock [FrameworkSQLiteOpenHelperFactory] and delegates every lifecycle
 * callback (configure/create/migrate/open) to Room's real callback UNCHANGED, so migrations behave
 * exactly as before. Only `onCorruption` is replaced: it logs loudly, closes the handle, and moves
 * the corrupt file aside to a TIMESTAMPED `.corrupt.<epochMillis>` quarantine (best-effort), keeping
 * the newest [MAX_CORRUPT_QUARANTINES] and pruning older ones so a crash loop can't multiply 100 MB
 * files (#661). It never silently discards the newest corrupt copy — repeated corruption preserves
 * the latest (most recovery-worthy) data, not just the first. The trade-off is deliberate and matches
 * [WhoopDatabase]'s no-destructive-fallback doctrine: the app may then fail to open the store (the
 * user sees an error instead of a silently empty app), but the corrupt file survives for
 * backup/recovery instead of vanishing.
 *
 * `allowDataLossOnRecovery` is pinned FALSE for the same reason: androidx's recovery path deletes
 * the file when an open fails, which is exactly the destruction this factory exists to prevent.

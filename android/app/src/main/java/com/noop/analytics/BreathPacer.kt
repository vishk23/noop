/*
 * BreathPacer.kt — turn a breathing pace into a deterministic inhale/exhale haptic cue list you can
 * "feel" with your eyes closed, screen-off. PURE + unit-tested; the BLE layer maps each [BreathCue] onto
 * the strap's actual haptic command ([WhoopBleClient.buzz]) and schedules the gaps. No I/O here.
 *
 * Faithful Kotlin mirror of StrandAnalytics/BreathPacer.swift — keep the cue list byte-identical to Swift
 * (cross-platform parity is the contract, pinned by matching golden-vector tests).
 * See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-19-v5-haptic-biofeedback-design.md (L1 "Act (the pacer)").
 *
 * Felt language (identical to the shipped Breathe screen, so existing users already know it):
 *   • Inhale onset → ONE light pulse  (loops: 1)
 *   • Exhale onset → TWO pulses       (loops: 2)
 * Each WHOOP notification buzz is a FIXED-LENGTH motor pulse — we can't vary on-time per pulse, only the
 * *count* (stacked loops) and the *timing*. So the cue is encoded purely as "fire N loops at offset T".
 *
 * A breath cycle of `bpm` breaths/min lasts 60000/bpm ms; `inhaleFraction` splits it into inhale vs
 * exhale (the calming long-exhale ratio Breathe's "Relax" preset uses is ~0.4 inhale : 0.6 exhale).

/// See `RescoreBackgroundPolicy` for the problem (#1538) and the decision rules. This is the plumbing:
/// the durable "a re-score is owed" mark, the measured duration the policy reads, the iOS
/// execution assertion, and the `BGProcessingTask` that work is escalated to.
///
/// `BGProcessingTask` rather than `BGAppRefreshTask` — the two the app already uses (the scheduled debug
/// export, the Health write-back) are refresh tasks, which are metered for short work. Processing tasks are
/// the long, deferrable kind, which is what an eight-minute pass needs. iOS decides when one runs and
/// favours idle and charging, so this is an "eventually, without needing the user to hold the app open"
/// guarantee, NOT a promise that a score appears moments after a sync. Nothing here claims otherwise, and
/// the honest limit is worth stating: on an install where the pass takes minutes, the score still normally
/// appears when the app is next opened. What changes is that the phone stops paying for a full doomed pass
/// on every single offload to get there.
///
/// HONEST about platform limits, in the shape of `ScheduledDebugExport`:
/// - **macOS** — the app is a normal foreground app with no suspension deadline. Every entry point here is
///   a no-op that reports `.run`, so the existing behaviour is exactly preserved.
/// - **iOS** — needs the `processing` background mode AND the identifier listed in
///   `BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers` AND `register()` called before launch finishes. If any of those
///   is missing, `submit` fails gracefully and the foreground path still scores normally.

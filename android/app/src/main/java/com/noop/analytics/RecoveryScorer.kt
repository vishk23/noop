/*
 * RecoveryScorer.kt — resting HR during sleep + a transparent 0–100 recovery score
 * (NOOP "Charge").
 *
 * Faithful Kotlin port of StrandAnalytics/RecoveryScorer.swift (verified on macOS),
 * itself ported from server/ingest/app/analysis/recovery.py.
 *
 * recovery() is a z-score + logistic composite. It is APPROXIMATE — not
 * WHOOP-identical (WHOOP's model is proprietary). It is a transparent,
 * HRV-dominant, baseline-normalized proxy.
 *
 * Weighting (documented, grounded, explainable):
 *   higher HRV vs baseline        → higher recovery  (W_HRV   = 0.55, dominant)
 *   lower resting HR vs baseline   → higher recovery  (W_RHR   = 0.20)
 *   lower resp vs baseline         → higher recovery  (W_RESP  = 0.05)
 *   higher sleep performance       → higher recovery  (W_SLEEP = 0.15)
 *   skin temp NEAR baseline        → higher recovery  (W_SKIN_TEMP = 0.05)
 *
 * Skin temp is a SYMMETRIC penalty: further from the personal baseline in EITHER
 * direction (illness / overreach) lowers Charge. It enters as −|dev| / scale, like
 * the "lower is better" terms but on the absolute deviation. When skinTempDev is null
 * the term drops and the remaining weights renormalize, so the score is IDENTICAL to
 * the pre-skin-temp model (the no-skin-temp path is byte-for-byte unchanged).
 *
 * Two OPTIONAL Oura-Readiness-style terms (dormant until a caller supplies them):
 *   overnight resting-HR DECLINE slope ("Recovery Index")      → W_RECOVERY_INDEX    = 0.05
 *   previous-day Effort vs personal baseline ("Activity Balance" /
 *   "Previous Day Activity", collapsed into one term)          → W_ACTIVITY_BALANCE  = 0.05
 * Both are ADDITIVE and NON-BREAKING: each is null unless the caller supplies it, in which
 * case it folds in with its small weight above; when null the term drops and the weights
 * renormalize exactly like the skin-temp term, so the default score for every existing caller
 * is BYTE-IDENTICAL to before either term existed. Recovery Index needs no personal baseline
 * (a fixed, documented bpm/hour scale, same style as sleepPerf/skin-temp); Activity Balance
 * needs BOTH the previous-day Effort value AND its EWMA baseline ([Baselines.strainCfg]) —
 * supplying only one drops the term.
 *
 * Each metric is standardized to a robust z-score against the personal baseline
 * (mean + EWMA-abs-dev spread). Missing terms are dropped and the weights
 * renormalized. The composite z is squashed through a logistic anchored so that
 * Z = 0 → ~58% (WHOOP's published population-average recovery).
 *
 * Cold-start: if the HRV baseline (dominant driver) is not yet usable
 * (< MIN_NIGHTS_SEED valid nights), recovery() returns null. Callers may use
 * [populationMean] (58.0) as a fallback but should flag it.
 *
 * `start` / `end` are wall-clock unix SECONDS (Long), matching the com.noop.data
 * layer and HrSample.ts (the Swift source uses Int seconds).

    // ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    //
    // A low nightly HRV is normally a fatigue signal, so the HRV term (wHRV = 0.55, the dominant
    // driver) pulls Charge DOWN. There is a CANDIDATE benign pattern the raw z-score may mis-read:
    // parasympathetic (vagal) saturation. In a very fit or very relaxed state the RMSSD-HRV response
    // can saturate and read LOW while resting HR reads LOW too, and the two DECOUPLE. On such a night
    // the dominant HRV penalty tanks Charge even though the person is well rested.
    //
    // The candidate discriminator is the SIGN of the resting-HR term versus the HRV term. recovery()
    // builds the HRV term as (hrv - mu)/sigma (NEGATIVE when HRV is below baseline = the penalty) and
    // the RHR term as (mu - rhr)/sigma (POSITIVE when resting HR is below baseline = recovery-good). In
    // a normally-coupled autonomic response a low HRV travels WITH a HIGH resting HR (sympathetic
    // drive), so both terms point the SAME way (down). When instead the HRV term points "bad" while the
    // resting-HR term points "good", the expected HRV<->RHR coupling has broken.
    //
    // ── WHY THE EASING IS COMPUTED BUT DELIBERATELY NOT APPLIED ─────────────────────────────────
    //
    // This code DETECTS the signature and REPORTS the easing it would apply, but recovery() does NOT
    // consume it: the Charge number is byte-identical to pre-guard behaviour. Two reasons, both
    // currently unresolved:
    //
    //   1. VALIDATION GAP. The real-data validation behind this guard recorded ZERO firings over ~2
    //      weeks. That is evidence the gate does not OVER-fire; it is NOT evidence that the easing is
    //      the right size, or right at all, on a real saturation night, because no real saturation
    //      night was ever observed. Every night that would actually move Charge is covered by
    //      synthetic fixtures only (see RecoverySaturationGuardTest).
    //   2. CONTESTED PREMISE. Low HRV + low resting HR is ALSO a reported signature of parasympathetic
    //      (non-functional) OVERREACHING, which is genuinely maladaptive. From the HRV/RHR pair alone,
    //      benign saturation and overreaching are not distinguishable, and they want OPPOSITE Charge
    //      corrections. Easing the penalty on an overreaching night would hide a real problem.
    //
    // So the guard ships INSTRUMENT-FIRST: detection is live and surfaces in the Charge trace (the
    // "charge saturation active ... wouldRaiseCharge=N" line) and in the RecoveryDrivers HRV verdict,
    // so real low-HRV + low-RHR nights accumulate and can be checked against ground truth. Enabling the
    // easing is a follow-up gated on confirmed real firings, not on the synthetic fixtures.
    //
    // TO ENABLE LATER: feed [ParasympatheticSaturation.easedHrvZ] into the HRV term at the marked call
    // site in recovery(), and flip the tests that currently pin the score as UNCHANGED.

     * @param sleepPerf sleep-performance proxy (Rest composite 0..1, or efficiency
     *   0..1 for legacy callers); null drops the term.
     * @param skinTempDev tonight's skin-temperature deviation from the personal
     *   baseline (raw ±°C, DailyMetric.skinTempDevC); applied as a SYMMETRIC penalty

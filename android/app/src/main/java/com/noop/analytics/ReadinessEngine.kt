/**
 * On-device "Readiness" intelligence.
 *
 * Synthesizes a handful of established, non-medical sports-science signals from the daily-metrics
 * history into a single readiness read plus the drivers behind it. Everything here is a pure,
 * deterministic function of the rows you pass in — no networking, no strap commands, no state.
 *
 * Faithful Kotlin port of
 * Packages/StrandAnalytics/Sources/StrandAnalytics/ReadinessEngine.swift (verified on macOS).
 * Same windows, same thresholds, same outputs.
 *
 * Signals and their references:
 * - **HRV readiness** — z-score of today's HRV against the personal trailing baseline. A drop of
 *   roughly half a standard deviation flags autonomic fatigue (Plews et al. 2013; Buchheit 2014).
 * - **Resting-HR drift** — elevated resting HR vs baseline is a classic overtraining / illness
 *   signal (Lamberts et al. 2004).
 * - **Respiratory-rate drift** — a rise in sleeping respiratory rate is an early illness signal.
 * - **Training Stress Balance (ACWR)** — acute (7-day) vs chronic (28-day) strain. The 0.8–1.3
 *   band is the "sweet spot"; >1.5 is associated with higher injury risk (Gabbett 2016).
 * - **Training monotony** — mean/SD of daily strain over a week; high monotony (low variety) is
 *   associated with higher strain and illness (Foster 1998).
 *
 * Not medical advice. These are approximations from a consumer strap; they describe trends in
 * *your own* data, nothing more.

// HRVFreqDomain.swift, frequency-domain HRV (LF / HF / LF-HF / total power) over an R-R series.
//
// PURELY ADDITIVE. This file introduces NO change to any Charge / Effort / Rest / sleep output; it is a
// brand-new, opt-in estimator the UI lanes surface later. The existing time-domain HRVAnalyzer (RMSSD /
// SDNN / pNN50) is untouched.
//
// WHY LOMB-SCARGLE, NOT AN FFT. A tachogram (the series of successive R-R intervals plotted against their
// own cumulative time) is UNEVENLY sampled by construction: each interval's timestamp is the running sum of
// the preceding intervals, so the samples are not on a fixed grid. The classical HRV pipeline resamples the
// tachogram onto a uniform grid (e.g. 4 Hz) and runs an FFT, but that resampling is itself a low-pass
// interpolation that distorts the high-frequency (HF / respiratory) band, exactly the band that matters
// most for parasympathetic tone. The Lomb-Scargle periodogram (Lomb 1976, Scargle 1982) estimates the power
// spectrum DIRECTLY from the unevenly sampled points with no interpolation, and is the estimator recommended
// for HRV on irregular tachograms (Laguna, Moody & Mark 1998; Clifford & Tarassenko 2005). So we compute it
// directly on the (t_k, rr_k) pairs.
//
// This generalises the band-limited DFT already used in SleepStagerV2.respRegularity (a uniform-grid DFT
// restricted to the respiratory band): here the same "evaluate the spectrum only at the bins/frequencies we
// care about" idea is applied, but with the Lomb-Scargle estimator so no resampling is needed and arbitrary
// frequencies (the LF/HF band edges) can be probed.
//
// TASK FORCE (1996) BANDS AND SPAN GATES:
//   • VLF  : 0.0033–0.04 Hz  (folded into total power only; not reported on its own, needs many minutes)
//   • LF   : 0.04–0.15  Hz   (~7–37 s period)
//   • HF   : 0.15–0.40  Hz   (~2.5–6.7 s period; the respiratory band)
//   • LF/HF: the ratio of the two band powers.
//
// A periodogram can only resolve a frequency whose period fits inside the record several times. The Task
// Force short-term standard is a 5-minute (300 s) recording; we relax that to honest MINIMUM spans:
//   • HF needs >= 60 s of R-R span (its slowest component, 0.15 Hz, is a ~6.7 s period, ~9 cycles in 60 s).
//   • LF (and therefore LF/HF and a meaningful total power) needs >= 250 s of span (its slowest component,
//     0.04 Hz, is a 25 s period, only ~10 cycles even at 250 s; below that the LF estimate is unreliable).
// Below 60 s of span the whole result is nil; between 60 s and 250 s HF is returned but LF / LF-HF are nil.
//
// APPROXIMATE, non-clinical. Units are ms^2 (power of an R-R series in ms), the conventional HRV unit.

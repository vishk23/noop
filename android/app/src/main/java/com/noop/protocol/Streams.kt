/**
 * Convert a raw `skin_temp_raw` register value to °C, DEVICE-FAMILY-AWARE (#938).
 *
 * The two families bank skin temp on DIFFERENT scales, and applying one family's scale to the other is a
 * real decode bug: the historical `skin_temp_raw` field is a RAW ADC on the WHOOP 4.0 (v24 @72, "degC
 * computed server-side" per the schema) but a CENTIDEGREE register on the 5/MG (v18 @73). A single
 * family-blind `raw/100` sent every 4.0 night ~8 °C low, below the 28 °C worn gate, so skin temp and the
 * illness signal vanished (issue #938, reporter dpguglielmi's 4.0 capture).
 *
 * - [DeviceFamily.WHOOP5]: `raw / 100`. PROVEN on real 5/MG captures (Whoop5HistoricalTests: worn 3057 =
 *   30.6 °C, off-wrist 2247 = 22.5 °C). Unchanged.
 *
 * - [DeviceFamily.WHOOP4]: a single-anchor affine map. The 4.0 firmware (41.17.6.0) banks byte-72 at 1 Hz
 *   ON-WRIST ONLY, so there is ONE solid anchor and NO clean off-wrist room anchor from the strap. The
 *   reporter's doff/don capture gives a steady worn resting value of raw ~826 (worn steady ~830–865; a
 *   no-contact floor ~510–520 at removal, then banking stops). Under `/100` that reads ~8.3 °C — impossible
 *   for a wrist streaming a resting HR (~52 bpm). We anchor the worn value at a defensible nocturnal wrist
 *   skin temperature (33.0 °C ↔ the worn anchor raw) and carry a PROVISIONAL slope until a second
 *   calibration point exists. Because downstream use is a deviation from the user's OWN nightly baseline
 *   (skinTempDevC), the offset is what must be right to clear the absolute 28–42 °C worn gate + 20–42 °C
 *   baseline clamp; a slope error only rescales the deviation and stays directionally correct. All 4.0
 *   values APPROXIMATE.
 *
 *   PER-DEVICE ANCHOR (#938 second capture): [anchorRaw] is the raw that maps to 33.0 °C. It defaults to the
 *   global [Whoop4SkinTemp.ANCHOR_RAW] (826, first reporter's strap) so every existing caller is byte-
 *   identical, but the register OFFSET is per-device — a second real 4.0 strap shows the SAME floor (~509)
 *   and saturation (2047) yet a worn band of ~1100–1600 (nightly mean raw ~1290), which the global 826
 *   anchor maps to 47–72 °C (all samples fail the worn gate). The analytics caller therefore learns
 *   [anchorRaw] from the device's OWN worn median ([Whoop4SkinTemp.deviceAnchorRaw]) so the worn band lands
 *   in range; the constant offset cancels in the deviation-from-own-baseline the app consumes.
 *
 *   TODO(#938): replace the provisional slope with the exact two-point anchor once a second worn point at a
 *   markedly different ambient pins the ADC→°C transfer (including whether it is linear). Until then this is
 *   a defensible worn-range mapping, NOT a claimed-accurate absolute thermometer. Kept in lockstep with the
 *   Swift `skinTempCelsius(raw:family:anchorRaw:)`.

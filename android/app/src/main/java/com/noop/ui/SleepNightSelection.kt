 * The day's REPRESENTATIVE session is its MAIN sleep block — the LONGEST block, preferring an

 * the same calendar day, so both bucket here); the OLD `maxByOrNull { endTs }` picked the
 * latest-ending block, which is the afternoon nap — so the overnight vanished from the Sleep tab.
 * Picking the longest overnight block fixes it; the other blocks are carried as `napBlocks` for
 * the naps card. The day key tries UTC then local-tz attribution of the MAIN block's wake — imported
 * DailyMetric.day is local-tz while dayString is UTC, so a near-midnight-UTC wake needs the second
 * key; both derive from THIS night's endTs, never another night. (#160, #518)

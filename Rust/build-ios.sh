# Builds Liters.xcframework + the Swift bindings NOOP compiles, from the pinned liters-ffi git
# dependency, and writes the xcconfig that links them.
#
# Run this once before building the app with the page-replication trial. Afterwards a plain
# `xcodegen generate && xcodebuild …` picks the archive up with no extra flags: the last step here
# writes Config/LitersLocal.xcconfig, which the tracked Config/Liters.xcconfig optionally includes.
# Without that file every liters build setting expands to empty and the app builds exactly as it
# does today, so running this script is opt-in and skipping it is not an error.
#
# Prereqs:
#   rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim x86_64-apple-ios \
#                     aarch64-apple-darwin x86_64-apple-darwin
#   Xcode command line tools
#
# There is deliberately no bundled/system switch here. NOOP links GRDB, which links Apple's system
# libsqlite3, so liters MUST link that same libsqlite3 — `Cargo.toml` pins `liters-ffi` with
# `default-features = false` to guarantee it, and this script has no way to opt back in. See
# Cargo.toml for why two SQLite copies in one process is a correctness bug rather than a size
# problem, and the SANITY CHECK below, which fails the build if it ever stops holding.

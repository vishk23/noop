/**
 * Estimate daily steps for a WHOOP 4.0 from the strap's MOTION, calibrated per-user against a phone
 * step count (Apple Health / Health Connect). Byte-for-byte twin of the Swift StepsEstimateEngine.
 *
 * WHY A CALIBRATED ESTIMATE, NOT A PEDOMETER. A WHOOP 4.0 does not send a step count over BLE, and the
 * gravity data we DO get is sparse (~one vector per stored record, ~minute granularity) — far below the
 * ~25–50 Hz a true step counter needs to see footfalls. So we cannot count steps. We CAN measure movement
 * VOLUME (how much the gravity vector moved over the day) and map it to steps with a coefficient learned
 * from days where the phone ALSO counted steps. The output is always framed as an estimate.
 *
 * THE MODEL. `steps ≈ k · motionIntensity`, through-origin. `k` (steps per unit of motion) is the only free
 * parameter and is PERSONAL (wrist placement, gait, how the strap rides) — hence calibrated per user, not a
 * global constant. We fit `k` robustly (a MOTION-WEIGHTED median of per-day steps/motion ratios) so one odd
 * day can't drag it AND high-activity days drive the fit (#682): a busy 15,000-step day pins the ratio far
 * more reliably than a near-still 500-step day, so motion VOLUME votes, not every day equally. A user with no
 * phone step history can set `k` by hand with the calibration slider.

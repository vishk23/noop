/**
 * Post-sync self-heal for the edit-races-sync bug. Port of iOS PR #449
 * (Repository.restageFromRaw + Repository.selfHealEditedStages).
 *
 * THE BUG: when a user hand-corrects a night's wake (or bed) time via
 * [WhoopRepository.updateSleepSessionTimes], the stages are reshaped by [SleepWindowReclip] — which
 * FABRICATES a trailing "wake" block when no real per-second staging is available — and the row is
 * stamped `userEdited = true`. If the correction was made BEFORE the strap sync imported that night's
 * raw streams (or even after, but the reclip still only reshapes the stored summary), the post-sync
 * recompute PRESERVES the edit (correct) but NEVER re-derives the real stage breakdown from the
 * now-available raw sensor data — so the approximate/reclipped stages are frozen forever instead of
 * the real per-second staging WHOOP would show.
 *
 * THE FIX: a pass invoked from [IntelligenceEngine] (which runs after each sync backfill, before the
 * scoring loop) re-derives stages from the now-available raw over each edited night's LOCKED bounds
 * (effective onset → wake) and rewrites the stage breakdown ONLY — never the user's bed/wake
 * correction, never the `userEdited` flag. Lives in the analytics package (not the repository, as on
 * iOS) because [SleepStager.stageSession] is `internal` to `com.noop.analytics`; it takes the
 * [WhoopRepository] as a parameter, exactly as [IntelligenceEngine] already does.
 *
 * Idempotent + safe:
 *   - A night already staged from raw re-derives to byte-identical JSON ([AnalyticsEngine.encodeStages]
 *     is deterministic — sorted keys), so the equality check skips the write (steady state, no churn).
 *   - A night edited-too-early heals the moment its raw arrives and is dense.
 *   - A true imported night (raw never dense) is left untouched ([restageFromRaw] returns null).
 *   - Only ever touches `userEdited = 1` rows (the DAO query is scoped), and never moves the bounds.

/**
 * On-demand "take an HRV reading now" — the single-value spot RMSSD path (#537, @sunny-noop).
 *
 * This wraps NOOP's canonical [HrvAnalyzer] for the LIVE, user-triggered HRV snapshot the Live screen
 * captures over ~60 s of beat-to-beat (R-R) intervals. It exists so the spot value, its honesty gate,
 * and its data-quality caveat live in ONE tested place rather than being re-derived in the view.
 *
 * Why delegate to [HrvAnalyzer] (and NOT roll our own RMSSD):
 *  - RMSSD is the textbook root-mean-square of successive R-R differences:
 *        RMSSD = sqrt( mean( (RR[i+1] - RR[i])^2 ) )   in ms.
 *  - NOOP's nightly HRV (`avgHrv`, fed into Vitality / Fitness Age) uses [HrvAnalyzer.rmssdRaw], which
 *    takes the Task Force (1996) SAMPLE denominator (n-1) over the cleaned NN series. To keep a spot
 *    reading COMPARABLE to the overnight number a user sees elsewhere, this path computes RMSSD the
 *    SAME way (same cleaning pipeline, same (n-1) denominator). Using a population (n) denominator —
 *    as a from-scratch port might — would make the same beats read a few percent lower than the
 *    nightly figure, which is misleading. Consistency with the existing scorer is the whole point.
 *
 * Honesty is built in, not bolted on:
 *  - A number is returned ONLY when enough CLEAN beats survive ([HrvAnalyzer.MIN_BEATS]); otherwise the
 *    result is [Insufficient] with the surviving/needed counts so the UI can say so plainly (never a
 *    fabricated value, unknown stays "—").
 *  - The caveat ([caveatFor]) is source-aware: a 60 s spot reading is not the overnight baseline, it
 *    needs enough beats, and R-R derived from a WHOOP 5/MG's optical PPG is noisier than a chest strap's
 *    electrical R-R. Pure strings, US-neutral, no em-dashes.
 *
 * Pure arithmetic + small data holders, no I/O — fully unit-testable against a known RR series.

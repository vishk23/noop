/**
 * Locks the Today HR card's window-narrowing contract (#985's UX reimplemented under the #829 view-only
 * rule): a window NEVER re-queries the DB — it only narrows which of the already-loaded 5-minute buckets
 * render — so the entire behaviour lives in the pure cutoff/filter seam tested here. If someone "improves"
 * this into a re-read (the shape PR #985 originally proposed), these are the tests to argue with first.

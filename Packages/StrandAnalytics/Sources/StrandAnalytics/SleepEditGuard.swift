/// macOS/iOS (SleepTimeEditor) and Android (com.noop.analytics.SleepEditGuard, byte-for-byte twin),

///   1. `autoCorrectedBed`: a time-only roll that lands the bed in the future, or at/after the
///      night's wake, almost always means the PREVIOUS evening; auto-decrement the date.
///   2. `isDisjoint`: a corrected window with no overlap of the night's recorded coverage needs an
///      explicit confirm ("this moves the night to a time with no recorded data"), never silent
///      acceptance.
///   3. `clampedEditWindow`: the repository belt-and-braces; no code path may persist a future or
///      inverted window even if a client UI misbehaves.

/// EXPERIMENTAL, ISOLATED live-BLE source for the Oura ring (gen 3/4/5), driven by the clean-room
/// `OuraProtocol.OuraDriver`.
///
/// This is a real transport (it replaced an earlier honest dead-end probe): it decodes the ring's OWN
/// raw signals + open event tags (HR / IBI / HRV / SpO2 / temp / sleep-phase / battery), persists them
/// under the ring's `deviceId`, and lets NOOP compute its own Charge/Rest from those streams exactly like
/// a WHOOP day. It NEVER reads or surfaces Oura's encrypted readiness/sleep scores (honest-data
/// invariant), and when a signal can't be read it stays at "-", never a fabricated value (Huami precedent).
///
/// WHOOP-FIRST ISOLATION (identical to `StandardHRSource` / `HuamiHRSource`): this class runs its OWN
/// `CBCentralManager` and never imports, calls, or shares state with `BLEManager` / `WhoopBleClient`. The
/// WHOOP path cannot regress. The only shared surfaces are `LiveState` and the injected closures
/// (`persist`, `log`, `onBattery`). All BLE specifics live here; all protocol specifics live in the pure,
/// headless-testable `OuraDriver` (no CoreBluetooth in that package).
///
/// Honest about the handshake, step by step:
///   1. Scan for the Oura GATT service and filter discoveries by `OuraRingGen.recognise`.
///   2. Connect, discover the write/notify characteristics, enable notifications on ...0003.
///   3. Run the application auth challenge through `OuraDriver` (GetAuthNonce -> compute proof ->
///      Authenticate). The 16-byte install key is injected via `authKey`; when it is nil (or auth fails
///      because the ring is in factory reset / wrong key) we surface an HONEST `needsPairing` message and
///      stream NO data rather than faking one.
///   3a. ADOPT (factory-reset ring + explicit consent only): when the ring is in factory reset (auth status
///      `inFactoryReset` / no key) AND `adoptIntent == true`, the transport PROVISIONS a fresh 16-byte key:
///      it writes the dangerous `0x24` install, awaits the `0x25` OK ack, persists the key to `OuraKeyStore`,
///      then re-runs auth with the new key (s3.2). Without `adoptIntent` the dangerous opcode is NEVER sent;
///      we announce needs-pairing instead. A failed install is honest (Failed), never a fake success.
///   4. On auth success, run the gen-appropriate live-HR enable triplet; HR/IBI then streams as 0x2F
///      sub-op 0x28 pushes which the driver decodes.
///   5. Once streaming, also run a `GetEvents` HISTORY FETCH (s5) from the last-persisted cursor, and
///      periodically thereafter. Skin temp and SpO2 are SLEEP-ONLY on this hardware (neither ever arrives
///      as a live push, only as banked history), so the fetch is the only way last night's readings ever
///      reach the app. Fetched records are stamped with their real ring-time-anchored UTC (s5.5, from the
///      ring's own 0x42 time-sync event), NOT the wall-clock arrival time, so "last night" data is never
///      mis-timestamped as "now".
///   6. Decoded events map onto `Streams` via `OuraStreamMapping` and persist in batches; live HR also
///      feeds `LiveState`. Temp/SpO2/HRV/sleep-phase persist ONLY (no live surface - they are last-night
///      values, not a live readout). Battery is requested once streaming starts (`GetBattery`, 0x0C ->
///      0x0D) and feeds `onBattery`/`batteryPct`.

// MARK: - v17 store: Lab Book markers
//
// LabMarkerStore.swift — GRDB CRUD over the `labMarker` table (migration v17), the
// source-of-truth for the Health Records "Lab Book" pillar
// (spec 2026-06-19-v5-health-records-design.md §"New").
//
// The book is `labMarker` (one row per dated reading the user entered themselves);
// the daily `metricSeries` projection under source id `lab-book` is HOW the book talks
// to the rest of the app (Compare / Explore / correlation / Coach see it unchanged).
// On every write this store ALSO upserts that daily projection, exactly as the spec
// requires, so the two never drift.
//
// Mirrors the established `MetricSeriesStore` / `DeviceRegistryStore` idiom precisely:
// a plain Codable row struct, raw `Row` fetch + manual decode, idempotent upserts keyed
// by the natural key, all GRDB work via the actor's `syncWrite` / `syncRead` helpers.
//
// NON-CLINICAL: stores ONLY user-entered values + an OPTIONAL user-entered
// `referenceText` (their own report's range, verbatim). No reference-range tables, no
// normality judgement, ever.

/// One stored Lab Book reading. Natural key (deviceId, markerKey, takenAt, source) is
/// enforced by a UNIQUE index so re-importing the same reading is idempotent; `id` is a
/// stable client-generated identifier for edit/delete-by-id and backup round-trips.

// MARK: - Editable Key-Metrics layout (#251)
//
// The Today screen's "Key Metrics" grid was a fixed list of ten tiles in one order. This lets the user
// choose WHICH tiles show and in WHAT order, with the default being the original order so nothing changes
// for anyone who never opens the editor. Persistence is display-only — no metric is computed or stored
// differently; this just decides which of the already-computed tiles render and in what sequence.
//
// Stored as a single comma-joined string of metric keys in @AppStorage (UserDefaults), the same
// mechanism every other macOS NOOP preference uses. The Android side mirrors this exactly in
// KeyMetricPrefs.kt (SharedPreferences "today.keyMetrics"). Unknown keys are dropped on read and any
// known key missing from the saved list is appended (disabled) so a future tile addition can't be lost.

/// One of the Today screen's Key-Metric tiles. The rawValue is the stable persisted identifier — keep it
/// byte-identical to the Android `KeyMetric` enum so a backup/restore reads the same layout on either OS.

            // "charge, effort" dropped `effort` on the space alone. Kotlin's twin already does this
            // (`KeyMetric.fromRaw(token.trim())`), as does `DashboardCards.decodeEnabled`, so Swift was the
            // only decoder that could lose a tile the user had enabled.
            //
            // Latent rather than live: `encode` joins rawValues with no spaces, and this key is not in the
            // `.noopbak` whitelist, so nothing in the app writes a spaced value today. It is fixed because
            // a decoder that silently drops what it cannot parse should not also be picky about a space —
            // the capabilities decoder in this same change was exactly that, and there it WAS reachable.

/**
 * The ONE place the Oura ring's respiration rows are scaled, displayed and — deliberately — kept out
 * of scoring. Twin of Swift `WhoopStore.OuraRespScale`.
 *
 * `respSample` was built for a WHOOP 4.0's raw respiration ADC WAVEFORM (`resp_rate_raw@47`, 1 Hz,
 * unit `raw_adc`): a signal the stager runs a peak detector over. The ring sends no waveform at all;
 * its `0x6A sleep_period_info` record carries an already-computed RATE, one value per ~296 s window
 * (OURA_PROTOCOL.md s6.12). Two different physical quantities now share one table, so the row's OWNER
 * is what tells them apart — the same discipline `skinTempCelsius(raw, family)` already applies to
 * `skinTempSample`, which cannot be reused here because `DeviceFamily` has no Oura case by design
 * (#1086: a ring resolves to null, never to a coalesced whoop5).
 *
 * Everything that reads a respiration row therefore goes through one of the two entry points below —
 * [displayValue] to show it, [forScoring] to (not) score it — so a future reader is one grep away from
 * learning that the ring's rows are a rate, not a waveform.

     * this one increasingly is not (the ring computes it; see `OuraSleepPeriodInfo`). `SleepStager`
     * buckets `respSample` into epochs and runs `respRateAndRRV` — a peak detector that assumes a

     * depth call. A ring row is a per-window RATE: neither a waveform nor 1 Hz, so what it would
     * contribute is noise wearing the shape of a signal. Feeding a rate to a peak detector is wrong
     * however good the rate is.
     *
     * Today the ring's ~296 s cadence puts fewer than the required 8 samples in any 5-minute window,

     * `OuraRespScoringExclusionTest`). That is luck, not a guarantee: a later change to the record
     * cadence, or a decoder that expanded one record into per-second rows, would quietly switch the
     * path on. Refuse it by provenance instead, where the reason stays legible.
     *
     * This is about the STAGER only. The same rows DO reach the daily metric by the other door:
     * [forVendorRate] hands them to `AnalyticsEngine`, which takes the night's median as
     * `dailyMetric.respRateBpm`. Stager input and nightly value are separate questions, and the answer
     * differs because the stager wants a waveform and the daily metric wants a rate.

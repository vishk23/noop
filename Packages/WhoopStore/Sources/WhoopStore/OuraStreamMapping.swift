/// target) can persist its samples through the SAME `StreamStore.insert` path the WHOOP pipeline uses,
/// keyed by the ring's own `deviceId`, without duplicating row-construction logic in the app target
/// where it can't be unit-tested. Parallels `StandardHRMapping`.
///
/// Honest-data invariant (hard): we surface only the ring's decoded raw signals + its own open event
/// tags (HR/IBI/HRV/SpO2/temp/sleep-phase/battery). We NEVER read or surface Oura's encrypted readiness
/// or sleep scores. NOOP computes its own Charge/Rest downstream from these per-device streams. The
/// `OuraHRV` 0x5D tag is the ring's OWN RMSSD-derived HRV signal (OURA_PROTOCOL.md s6.9), not a readiness
/// score; NOOP also independently reconstructs RMSSD from the IBI streams for its own scoring.
///
/// Timestamping: the live source streams a batch and stamps every row at the arrival wall-clock `ts`
/// (unix seconds), exactly as `StandardHRMapping.samples(...at:)` does. The decoded events carry only a
/// ring-clock `ringTimestamp` (a `(session << 16) | counter` value, NOT wall-clock), so anchoring is the
/// transport's job; the mapping stays pure and deterministic by taking the wall-clock `ts` as input. A
/// signal that could not be decoded never reaches this layer (the decoders return nil upstream), so a
/// missing stream stays empty here, never faked (Huami precedent).
///
/// Tier-B (UNVERIFIED) events are dropped: only Tier-A decoded signals map into `Streams`, so an
/// unverified summary can never silently feed scoring.

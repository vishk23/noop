// MARK: - On-device activity-file import (GPX / TCX / FIT) — source "activity-file"
//
// Lets a user bring in a single exported activity FILE from ANY brand — Garmin, Coros, Suunto,
// Wahoo, Polar, Strava, WHOOP, Apple, etc. — fully offline. The three universal interchange formats
// are covered:
//
//   • GPX  (XML)    — the universal GPS-track format. <trk><trkseg><trkpt lat lon> with optional
//                     <ele>, <time>, and Garmin TrackPointExtension HR/cadence. Every brand exports it.
//   • TCX  (XML)    — Garmin Training Center XML. <Activities><Activity><Lap><Track><Trackpoint> with
//                     HeartRateBpm, DistanceMeters, AltitudeMeters, Cadence, plus per-Lap summaries.
//   • FIT  (binary) — the Garmin/ANT native format. A 12/14-byte header, then definition + data
//                     records (little-endian). We decode the common activity/record/lap/session
//                     messages; rarer developer/message types are skipped (see ActivityFileImporter
//                     follow-up notes), never fatal.
//
// This is PARSING ONLY — exactly like LiftingImporter / WhoopExportImporter, it produces a normalized
// `ActivityFile` that the app layer maps 1:1 onto the existing `WorkoutRow` store path (the same one
// the WHOOP-CSV and manual-workout imports use). It never touches live data, scoring, or the WHOOP
// import paths.
//
// SECURITY: every byte here is UNTRUSTED. The XML parsers cap element depth and total trackpoints; the
// FIT decoder bounds every field read against the buffer, caps record/field counts, and rejects an
// implausible declared size — mirroring the StrandImport DoS guards (a crafted file must be rejected,
// never crash or OOM). Numeric → Int conversions are finite/range-checked (no trapping `Int(Double)`).

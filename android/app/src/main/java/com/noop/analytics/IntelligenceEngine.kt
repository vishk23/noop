/*
 * IntelligenceEngine.kt , on-device "intelligence": computes recovery / day-strain /
 * sleep from the raw strap streams using the same model shape WHOOP uses (HRV vs
 * personal baseline ~60%, resting HR ~20%, sleep ~15%, respiration ~5%; strain 0–21
 * from cardiovascular load).
 *
 * Faithful Kotlin port of Strand/Data/IntelligenceEngine.swift (verified on macOS).
 * Same windows, same thresholds, same persistence model:
 *   - For each recent day with >= MIN_HR_SAMPLES (200) HR samples, read a generous
 *     window of raw streams from the imported source ("my-whoop"), run
 *     AnalyticsEngine.analyzeDay against baselines folded from repo.days, and PERSIST
 *     the DailyMetric + sleep sessions under "<deviceId>-noop" (the computed source).
 *   - The repository merges these UNDER any imported "my-whoop" rows, so a real WHOOP
 *     import always wins; this only fills the days the strap collected but no import
 *     covered.
 *
 * This is what makes NOOP independent of WHOOP's cloud , for any day the strap
 * collected raw data with NOOP connected, NOOP scores it itself rather than relying on
 * the values WHOOP computed in the imported CSV.
 *
 * Stateless object (no ObservableObject equivalent here): the Compose layer observes
 * the repository's reactive day flow, so this engine just computes + persists, then the
 * caller (AppViewModel) lets the flow refresh the UI. All `ts` are unix SECONDS (Long).

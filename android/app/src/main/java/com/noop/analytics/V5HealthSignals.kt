/**
 * V5HealthSignals — the small, pure adapter that turns the app's cached merged [DailyMetric] history into
 * the per-night z-scored inputs the three v5 skin-temp-suite engines consume, and runs them once per
 * analytics pass. It owns NO I/O and NO state: the caller (AppViewModel) hands it the already-loaded
 * `recentDays` list + a few prefs/profile flags and gets back a [Snapshot] of engine RESULTS to publish.
 *
 * Why a lightweight z here (not the full [Baselines] EWMA): the cards only need a deviation-against-your-
 * own-recent-range read ("further from your baseline than usual"), and the cached daily columns already
 * carry RHR / HRV / skin-temp-deviation / respiration. A rolling mean+SD over the trailing window is the
 * honest, transparent statistic the spec asks for (an observation about your own number) and keeps this
 * pass cheap + DB-free. The engines themselves (CyclePhaseEngine / CircadianEngine / IllnessSignalEngine)
 * are the byte-for-byte cross-platform maths; this file is only the Android-side input plumbing.
 *
 * NON-CLINICAL: every output is an approximation about the user's own series — never a diagnosis. Cycle
 * awareness is OPT-IN (the caller gates on a default-OFF pref before reading [Snapshot.cycle]).
 *
 * See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-19-v5-skin-temp-suite-design.md and the umbrella IA (§2.4 Health hub).

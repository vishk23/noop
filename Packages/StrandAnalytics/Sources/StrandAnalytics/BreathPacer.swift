// BreathPacer.swift — turn a breathing pace into a deterministic inhale/exhale haptic cue list you can
// "feel" with your eyes closed, screen-off. PURE + unit-tested; the BLE layer maps each `BreathCue` onto
// the strap's actual haptic command (`AppModel.buzz(loops:)` / `send(.runHapticsPattern)`) and schedules
// the gaps with the proven `HapticClock` asyncAfter walk. No I/O here.
//
// See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-19-v5-haptic-biofeedback-design.md (L1 "Act (the pacer)").
//
// Felt language (identical to the shipped Breathe screen, so existing users already know it):
//   • Inhale onset → ONE light pulse  (loops: 1)
//   • Exhale onset → TWO pulses       (loops: 2)
// Each WHOOP notification buzz is a FIXED-LENGTH motor pulse — we can't vary on-time per pulse, only the
// *count* (stacked loops) and the *timing*. So the cue is encoded purely as "fire N loops at offset T".
//
// A breath cycle of `bpm` breaths/min lasts 60000/bpm ms; `inhaleFraction` splits it into inhale vs
// exhale (the calming long-exhale ratio Breathe's "Relax" preset uses is ~0.4 inhale : 0.6 exhale).
// Mirrors `HapticClock.pulses` in shape: a pure `(params) -> [Cue]` list, walkable by the BLE seam.

/**
 * PRE-STORAGE census of a decoded R-R batch (#1008/#1118 instrumentation). Byte-parity twin of Swift
 * `RrEmissionStats`.
 *
 * Every existing R-R number — `rrCoverage`, `collapsedCoverage`, the `hrv diag` line — is measured
 * AFTER the rows are stored, so it cannot distinguish the two candidate causes of the WHOOP 4.0
 * over-count:
 *
 *  * the strap/decoder EMITS more beat-time than elapsed (a decode or protocol reading), or
 *  * the same beats are STORED twice because two ingest passes both wrote them.
 *
 * [Result.ratio] settles it: Σ(rrMs) over the batch's own wall span, computed on the decoded batch
 * before a single row reaches the database. Near ~1.7 already means no storage-side de-dup can be the
 * fix and the defect is upstream of the DB; near 1.0 while the stored night still reads 1.7 means the
 * duplication is in ingest. Nothing in the shipped path reads any of this — instrumentation only.
 *
 * [Result.perSecond] characterises the shape rather than the size: at ~69 bpm a one-second record should
 * carry ONE interval (occasionally two, when two beats end inside the same second), so a fat 3-4 tail is
 * what a rolling/overlapping strap buffer would look like.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO cross-second repeat counter. Counting an interval that reappears verbatim one
 * second later cannot distinguish a re-sent beat from a STEADY HEART — at rest, consecutive real intervals
 * are near-identical by definition, so such a counter reads high on perfectly clean data and answers
 * nothing. [Result.ratio] carries the signal instead: it is bounded by physics, not by resemblance.

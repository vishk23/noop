// HRVAnalyzer.swift — RMSSD + SDNN from RR intervals with cleaning.
//
// Ported from server/ingest/app/analysis/hrv.py. The Task Force (1996) RMSSD and
// SDNN definitions are reproduced exactly:
//
//   RMSSD = sqrt( mean( (NN[i+1] − NN[i])^2 ) )           (Task Force 1996)
//   SDNN  = sample standard deviation of NN (ddof = 1)     (Task Force 1996)
//
// Cleaning pipeline:
//   1. Range filter: drop intervals outside [RR_MIN_MS, RR_MAX_MS] = [300, 2000] ms.
//   2. Ectopic rejection: drop beats whose RR deviates > ~20% from a local median
//      (Malik-style filter).
//   3. Require >= MIN_BEATS (20) valid intervals before a trustworthy result.
//
// NOTE: the Python source runs neurokit2's Kubios / Lipponen–Tarvainen (2019)
// artifact classifier, which is unavailable on-device. We substitute the
// classical Malik 20% local-median rule (Malik et al. 1989), the most widely
// cited ectopic-rejection heuristic. This is a simpler, fully-deterministic
// approximation of the same intent — remove physiologically impossible
// beat-to-beat jumps before computing HRV — at the cost of not modelling the
// missed/extra-beat insertion that Kubios does.

/**
 * Decode a sleep session's `stagesJSON` into stage MINUTE totals, and aggregate a night's blocks into
 * the sleep-derived daily fields. Pure + deterministic, so the daily-aggregate recompute that honors a
 * user's bed/wake-time edit can run off the stored (reshaped) stages — no raw streams needed.
 *
 * Faithful Kotlin port of StrandAnalytics/Sources/StrandAnalytics/SleepStageTotals.swift (the iOS
 * `dailyAggregateHonoringEdits` seam from PR #395), adapted to Android's two stagesJSON shapes:
 *   - on-device COMPUTED (what the IntelligenceEngine writes via [AnalyticsEngine.encodeStages]):
 *     `[{start,end,stage}]` — per-segment unix SECONDS spans;
 *   - IMPORTED (WhoopCsvImporter.stagesJson): `[{stage,min}]` — per-stage MINUTE totals.
 * The on-device stager calls awake "wake"; the importer "awake" — both map to `awake`.
 *
 * The edit/recompute path only ever feeds the COMPUTED (`-noop`) source's `[{start,end,stage}]` stages
 * here (the daily override is computed-source-only, mirroring iOS scope), but [minutes] handles both
 * shapes so the helper is a complete twin of the Swift one and is robust to either input.

/*
 * AnalyticsEngine.kt — orchestrator producing DailyMetric + sleep-session results.
 *
 * Faithful Kotlin port of StrandAnalytics/AnalyticsEngine.swift (verified on macOS).
 * Same algorithm, same constants, same thresholds; Kotlin-ized types, Double math.
 *
 * Given a day's raw streams + a user profile + personal baselines, it runs the
 * individual analyzers (SleepStager / RecoveryScorer / StrainScorer / WorkoutDetector
 * / Baselines) and assembles a [com.noop.data.DailyMetric] (Room cache shape) plus the
 * detected [DetectedSleep] sessions.
 *
 * This is a PURE function over its inputs — it does NOT touch the database
 * (persistence is wired by IntelligenceEngine). All derived values are APPROXIMATE.
 *
 * All `ts` / `start` / `end` are wall-clock unix SECONDS (Long); the Swift source
 * uses Int seconds.

     * streams already in memory — the dayHr/daySteps/dayGravity re-reads (~60 per pass, including the

     * it, which is a poor instrument to hand a volunteer and produces a number nobody can check.
     *
     * This makes the comparison one number against one number: the wearer reads this and the figure the
     * WHOOP app reports for the same night. The count travels with the mean on purpose — a mean over 11
     * readings and a mean over 1100 are not the same evidence.
     *
     * Gated to `70..100`, the SAME in-band window the decoder applies when it emits `spo2_candidate_82`:
     * sub-70 nonzero values are diagnostic codes and bit-7 values are saturation sentinels, so averaging

     * byte read out of the CAPPED aux table, built as a hand-checkable diagnostic. This is the scored
     * statistic, over the durable stream, and it corrects the two things that make the naive mean wrong.
     *
     * THE ACQUISITION RAMP. The strap does not sample SpO2 continuously: it takes a RUN of ~30 one-second
     * samples roughly once per ~1,200 s while asleep. The first samples of each run are the optical front
     * end settling, and they read LOW — so a mean over every in-band sample is biased downward by a
     * contamination that is entirely one-sided, and the bias grows with how much of the night is ramp
     * (i.e. it is worse on nights with more, shorter runs — precisely when you would least suspect it).
     * Runs are separated here by a gap of more than [SPO2_RUN_GAP_SECONDS]; at 1 Hz within a run and
     * ~1,200 s between runs, that boundary is not a close call. The leading [SPO2_RAMP_SAMPLES] of each
     * run are dropped — but never more than HALF a run, so a short run contributes its settled tail
     * instead of vanishing and silently reweighting the night toward whichever runs happened to be long.
     *
     * WHY THE MEDIAN AND NOT A TRIMMED MEAN. Three reasons, in order of weight:
     *   1. It is the statistic the cloud reader already reports (the per-night 94-97 medians every
     *      cross-check against this data has been quoted against). A phone that shipped a trimmed mean
     *      would disagree with the server on the same rows for no reason anyone could see.
     *   2. Ramp removal is a heuristic, not a proof. A partially-settled sample just past the cut, or a
     *      motion artifact mid-run, is residual one-sided contamination that a mean absorbs in full and a
     *      median very largely ignores.
     *   3. The in-band values live in a 31-wide integer band with a hard mode at 97, so a median is
     *      stable and interpretable here in a way it would not be on a sparse continuous quantity.
     * The trim and the median are complementary, not redundant: the trim removes a KNOWN, structured,
     * large block of low readings that would move a median too, and the median absorbs what is left.
     *
     * READ-TIME POLICY, DELIBERATELY. None of this is applied on the way into the store —
     * `spo2PctSample` holds raw in-band bytes. These rules have already changed once on the cloud side,
     * and they will change again if a run's shape turns out to differ by firmware; keeping them here
     * means that costs a re-score, not a re-capture of data the strap has long since trimmed.
     *
     * Pure + deterministic. Byte-parity twin of the Swift `AnalyticsEngine.nightlySpo2Pct`; the returned
     * pair is (median percentage, surviving sample count), matching Swift's `(pct:samples:)`.

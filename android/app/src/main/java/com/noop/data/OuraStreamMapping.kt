/**
 * Pure, JVM-testable mapping from the Oura ring's decoded [OuraEvent]s onto the datastore's
 * protocol [Streams] shape, so the WHOOP-isolated `OuraLiveSource` can persist its samples through
 * the SAME [WhoopRepository.insert] path (via [StreamPersistence.toBatch]) the WHOOP pipeline uses,
 * without duplicating row construction in the (untestable) app/BLE target. Kotlin twin of the Swift
 * `OuraStreamMapping` (WhoopStore), built from the architecture plan's section-4 table.
 *
 * HONEST-DATA INVARIANT (hard): we surface ONLY the ring's decoded raw signals and its OWN open
 * event tags. We never read or display Oura's encrypted readiness/sleep scores. NOOP computes its
 * own Charge/Rest downstream:
 *   - the IBI stream becomes [Streams.rr], from which RecoveryScorer reconstructs NOOP's OWN RMSSD;
 *   - the HR stream feeds resting-HR + strain;
 *   - the ring's open 0x5D HRV tag is recorded as `OURA_HRV` events carrying its honestly-labelled
 *     decoded fields (pair_index/hr_bpm/rmssd_ms) — the body is a run of (u8 avg HR bpm, u8 avg RMSSD
 *     ms) pairs, one per 5-min bucket; NOOP's own scoring RMSSD still comes from `rr`, not this tag;
 *   - the open sleep-phase tags become `OURA_SLEEP_PHASE` events folded into a sleep session.
 *
 * Each event carries a ring-clock `ringTimestamp` (not wall-clock). To stay pure and avoid baking a
 * clock model in here, the caller supplies an [anchor] resolving a ring timestamp to wall-clock unix
 * seconds (driven by the ring's 0x42/0x85 time-sync events upstream). When the anchor cannot place a
 * record (anchor returns null), the sample is DROPPED rather than stamped with a guessed time
 * (honest-data invariant), a ts-less biometric row is unstorable anyway.

     * every row — measured on a real database as 575,630 of 575,630 rows (#1072). With `ord` tied the
     * read falls through to `(rrMs, seq)`, i.e. a second's beats come back sorted by VALUE, and RMSSD —
     * built entirely from successive differences — is biased down by construction.
     *
     * One record's beats all carry that record's own ring time, so grouping by the resolved timestamp is
     * what hands the store a record's beats together. Order is the only property callers may rely on.

/**
 * Pure guards for the hand-edit sleep-time pickers (#940). The reporter corrected a late-tracked
 * night's bed time from 01:06 back to 23:00; the picker kept the calendar DATE, so the "corrected"
 * bed landed on the COMING evening: a future-dated night whose staged window came back all-awake,
 * and the Sleep tab then hid the intact history behind it. Three layered rules, the byte-for-byte
 * twin of Swift StrandAnalytics.SleepEditGuard, all pure and unit-tested:
 *   1. [autoCorrectedBed]: a time-only roll that lands the bed in the future, or at/after the
 *      night's wake, almost always means the PREVIOUS evening; auto-decrement the date.
 *   2. [isDisjoint]: a corrected window with no overlap of the night's recorded coverage needs an
 *      explicit confirm ("this moves the night to a time with no recorded data"), never silent
 *      acceptance.
 *   3. [clampedEditWindow]: the repository belt-and-braces; no code path may persist a future or
 *      inverted window even if a client UI misbehaves.

     * picker is time-only, so this always holds there). When the change was time-only (same
     * calendar day) and the candidate is impossible for a bed time, the user almost always meant the
     * previous evening: return the candidate moved one day back, provided that lands in the past.
     * Two impossibility cases:
     *   - the candidate is in the FUTURE ([candidateBedTs] > [nowTs]) - always corrected (this is the
     *     [originalWakeTs] == null "Add a nap" case too, whose anchor sits after the night's wake);

// MARK: - AppChangelog (ported byte-for-byte from Strand/System/AppChangelog.swift)
//
// Single source of truth for the in-app "What's New" sheet and the expectation-setting
// copy used in onboarding. Mirrored from the macOS `AppChangelog` enum so every surface
// — macOS, Android, the repo CHANGELOG.md — tells the exact same story.
//
// Icon mapping (SF Symbol → Material, all verified to resolve in material-icons-extended):
//   flask           → Icons.Outlined.Science        (independent / experimental)
//   checkmark.seal  → Icons.Outlined.VerifiedUser   (the supported path)
//   hourglass       → Icons.Outlined.HourglassEmpty (scores build over time)
//   lock.shield     → Icons.Outlined.Shield         (everything stays on-device)

/*
 * Room entities mirroring the verified GRDB schema in
 * Packages/WhoopStore/Sources/WhoopStore/Database.swift (+ MetricsCache.swift).
 *
 * That mirroring is CHECKED, not just described: `SchemaOracleTest` compares the schema Room's processor
 * generates from these entities against the shared `schema_oracle.json`, and the Swift `SchemaOracleTests`
 * compares GRDB's `PRAGMA table_info` against the same file. Editing an entity here — adding a column,
 * reordering fields, changing a type or nullability — fails that test until the GRDB twin lands with it or
 * the difference is written into the fixture's `divergenceReasons`. The notes below are a reader's summary
 * of what the oracle enforces.
 *
 * Natural keys mirror the Swift `ON CONFLICT(...) DO NOTHING` upserts so insert dedupe behaves identically,
 * with ONE deliberate exception noted inline:
 *   - hrSample        PK (deviceId, ts)
 *   - rrInterval      PK (deviceId, ts, rrMs, seq)  // v18: `seq` tiebreaks EQUAL same-second beats.
 *                                                   // Swift matches since WhoopStore `v24-rr-seq`; this
 *                                                   // note used to say the fix was still pending there.
 *   - event           PK (deviceId, ts, kind)
 *   - battery         PK (deviceId, ts)
 *   - spo2Sample      PK (deviceId, ts)
 *   - skinTempSample  PK (deviceId, ts)
 *   - respSample      PK (deviceId, ts)
 *   - gravitySample   PK (deviceId, ts)
 *   - dailyMetric     PK (deviceId, day)
 *   - sleepSession    PK (deviceId, startTs)
 *   - device          PK (id)
 *   - journal         PK (deviceId, day, question)
 *   - workout         PK (deviceId, startTs, sport)
 *   - appleDaily      PK (deviceId, day)
 *
 * `ts` columns are wall-clock unix SECONDS (Swift uses Int -> Kotlin Long for safety).

/**
 * R-R interval. Swift `rrInterval` (v1); PK widened in Room v18 to (deviceId, ts, rrMs, **seq**), adding
 * `seq` as a tiebreaker for two EQUAL R-R intervals that fall in the same 1-second `ts` bucket. Keying by
 * value alone (deviceId, ts, rrMs) + `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` silently dropped the second of two equal
 * successive beats in a second, removing a zero-difference pair and biasing RMSSD/HRV **high** — the bias
 * matters most at rest/sleep, exactly when HRV is scored. `seq` counts equal (ts, rrMs) beats (0, 1, …) so
 * both survive. DISTINCT intervals keep their own (ts, rrMs) slot exactly as before, so no distinct beat is
 * ever dropped — including across separate insert batches or the live/historical merge (rrMs stays in the
 * key). Re-syncing identical records reproduces the same (ts, rrMs, seq), so the insert stays idempotent.
 *
 * `ord` (Room v24, #823) is the beat's EMISSION order within its (deviceId, ts) group — the position the
 * strap sent it in, recorded at decode time. It is deliberately NOT in the key: the key must stay
 * (deviceId, ts, rrMs, seq) for the dedup/idempotency reasons above, and an insertion counter in the key
 * would collide distinct beats across batches. `ord` exists purely so reads can restore emission order.
 * Reads MUST order by it — see WhoopDao.rrIntervals. Without it, reads came back in MAGNITUDE order
 * (`ORDER BY ts, rrMs`), which sorts successive beats to be similar by construction and biases RMSSD
 * DOWN, since RMSSD is built entirely from successive differences.
 *
 * NULL means "emission order unknown": every row written before v24, and any row from a source that
 * cannot supply it. That is honest rather than a guess, and it sorts correctly for free — SQLite orders
 * NULL first in ASC, so a pre-v24 second (all NULL) ties on `ord` and falls through to the old
 * `rrMs, seq` order exactly. Not backfillable: the order was never recorded.
 *
 * `srcChannel` (Room v26, #1071) is WHICH sensor channel measured the beat, as [RrSourceChannel.code].
 * An Oura ring reports the SAME heartbeats on more than one tag — 0x80 green-quality for the whole wear
 * period, 0x6E only while an SpO2 measurement runs — and every one of them decoded to an R-R row, so an
 * untagged table held roughly TWO complete copies of every night (2.06x the beats the measured HR curve
 * allows over one 488-min window). That leaves the MEAN correct — resting HR was never wrong — and
 * destroys everything built on successive differences: RMSSD, and a ~200 ms nocturnal SDNN where a
 * healthy adult asleep is 40-100 ms.
 *
 * NOT a de-duplication: both rows are real measurements of one beat by different optics, and the second
 * channel is the obvious cross-check on the first. So nothing is deleted — the column labels the source
 * and `WhoopDao.rrIntervals` filters at READ. Also NOT in the key, for the same reason `ord` is not:
 * keying on the label would make the SAME beat insertable twice under two labels, which is the
 * double-count being fixed.
 *
 * NULL means "no channel to name": every WHOOP row forever (one beat source), every row written before
 * v26, and any source that does not report one. Pre-v26 rows are still READ — a filter that dropped NULL
 * would delete every WHOOP night from scoring — so historical Oura rows keep their old inflated
 * coverage. Not backfillable: the channel was never recorded. (For the record, since it is how this was
 * diagnosed: in an existing DB the two remain separable by `rrMs % 8`, an 0x6E row always being a
 * multiple of 8 and an 0x80 row landing there only 1 time in 8 by chance.)
 *
 * PARITY: the Swift `rrInterval` key was widened to match in WhoopStore `v24-rr-seq`, `ord` lands there
 * as `v30-rr-ord`, and `srcChannel` as `v32-rr-src-channel`. (An earlier revision of this note said the
 * Swift widening was still pending; it had already shipped.)

/**
 * Every remaining 5/MG v18 per-second field the decoder produces and the extractor used to DROP
 * (MIGRATION_24_25 / Swift WhoopStore `v31-deep-capture-channels`).
 *
 * `extractHistoricalStreams` names a dozen fields and silently discards the rest; the strap trims its
 * banked history as soon as NOOP acks the offload, so a field not banked here is gone permanently and can
 * never be censused, correlated, or validated. [fields] is a compact blob of the fifteen leftover slots
 * (see [V18AuxCodec] for the wire format and the column-vs-blob tradeoff) rather than fifteen nullable
 * columns on a hot per-second table.
 *
 * Its OWN table rather than a column on an existing row because no existing per-second table is
 * guaranteed present: `gravitySample` needs `gravity_x` to decode, `skinTempSample` needs @73 to clear
 * its thermal gate, `hrSample` skips bpm=0 — a v18 record can carry aux fields while every one of those
 * gated out. [fields] is NOT NULL because a row is only written when at least one slot is present:
 * absence is "no row", and within a row a clear bitmap bit, never a fabricated 0.
 *
 * The BLOB format is byte-identical to the Swift GRDB `V18AuxCodec` so a `.noopbak` round-trips. PK
 * (deviceId, ts) and field order (deviceId, ts, fields) mirror the GRDB schema.
 *
 * CAPPED, not unbounded: [WhoopRepository.V18_AUX_RETENTION_ROWS] rolling rows per device, the same shape
 * `rawImuSample` uses. This is the only NEW row growth v31 introduces — the columns added to the three
 * existing per-second tables widen rows that were already being written.
 *
 * INSTRUMENTATION ONLY: nothing reads these rows.
 *
 * CONSUMER STATUS — deliberately none, stated here so nobody has to re-derive it. The writer is live, but
 * every `v18AuxSamples` call site on BOTH platforms is a TEST: no analytic, no score, no gate, no UI, no
 * export reads a row. **Do NOT "clean up" the reader as dead code** — the rows are the point, and the
 * reader is how they become reachable once a consumer is validated. The same applies to the four named
 * columns v31/MIGRATION_24_25 added alongside this table (`gravitySample.dynAccel`,
 * `sleepStateSample.rawByte`, `skinTempSample.aux1Raw/aux2Raw`): they are read into their entities and no
 * consumer touches the properties, on purpose.
 *
 * Why the rows still matter unread: before this migration these fields were not merely unread, they were
 * DESTROYED — the strap trims its history the moment an offload is acked, so each one was unrecoverable.
 * This converts permanent loss into retained-but-unread, which is the whole fix and is complete. Fifteen
 * of the slots are unpinned bytes whose names deliberately assert nothing; wiring them to anything before
 * a census would be exactly the overclaiming this project has already had to retract. The capture IS the
 * deliverable. Twin of the Swift `v31-deep-capture-channels` migration note in `Database.swift`.

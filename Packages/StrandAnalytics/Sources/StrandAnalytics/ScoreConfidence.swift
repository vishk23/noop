// ScoreConfidence.swift — per-score certainty tier for Charge / Effort / Rest.
//
// Each daily score rides a confidence tier so a sparse 5/MG day (or a cold-start
// baseline) reads truthfully instead of faking a number. Surfaced as a small
// label/dot under each score; the score itself stays nil-honest where it can't
// compute at all.
//
// Tiers (ordered lowest → highest):
//   .calibrating — the baseline/seed isn't usable yet, or the core input window is
//                  absent (no HR window for Effort, no in-bed data for Rest, HRV
//                  baseline not yet usable for Charge). The number, if shown, is a
//                  placeholder.
//   .building    — usable but thin: enough to compute, but the baseline is still
//                  provisional or the inputs are partial (e.g. a day backed mostly by
//                  PPG-derived HR, or a short baseline history).
//   .solid       — full inputs present and the baseline is trusted.
//
// Kept deliberately small and dependency-free so the Kotlin mirror is byte-identical.

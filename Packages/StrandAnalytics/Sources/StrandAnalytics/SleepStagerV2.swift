// SleepStagerV2.swift — the DEFAULT sleep-staging recipe. It became the default over the older
// percentile-band stager `SleepStager` (V1) after a 44-subject cross-subject benchmark; V1 stays available
// behind the PuffinExperiment flag.
//
// Reimplemented clean from the contributor recipe in NoopApp/noop PR #600 (sunny-noop). We took only the
// per-session STAGING engine, not the CLI runner the PR shipped with it. Session DETECTION (the in-bed
// `[start, end]` spans) still comes entirely from V1 — this file only re-stages a window someone already
// decided is sleep, so it is a true drop-in for `SleepStager.stageSession(start:end:grav:hr:rr:resp:)`:
// SAME signature, SAME `[StageSegment]` return shape.
//
// HONEST HEDGING (same spirit as V1): these stages are APPROXIMATIONS, not PSG-validated, not medical
// advice. The recipe first shipped with only its author's n=1 validation; it is now the default because a
// 44-subject leave-one-subject-out benchmark (AAUWSS + Walch sleep-accel) showed it strictly dominates V1
// (kappa 0.35 vs 0.03, deep recall 55% vs 1%). The per-epoch coefficients are still fixed a-priori from
// sleep physiology + population base rates, not fit to labels.
//
// Where V1 runs a percentile-band classifier + median smoothing + physiology re-imposition over a
// Cole–Kripke actigraphy grid, V2 stages each 30 s epoch from:
//   1. per-night z-scored cardiorespiratory emissions (HR / HR-variability / movement);
//   2. a per-night DEEP gate on the 11-min HR-flatness percentile (the strongest deep-vs-light separator);
//   3. a soft sleep-cycle prior (deep concentrated early; REM suppressed in the first ~12% then rising);
//   4. a peak-motion (jerk) wake gate, thresholded RELATIVE to the night's own quiescent jerk floor — so
//      it self-calibrates to the strap's gravity-decode scale and the wearer's fit, not a fixed g;
//   5. an RR-RSA respiration-regularity term (regular breathing → deep, irregular → REM);
//   6. Viterbi/HMM transition smoothing with a sticky transition matrix.
// All coefficients are fixed a-priori from sleep physiology + population base rates (NOT fit to labels).

// OuraEvents: the decoded value structs the driver emits (OURA_PROTOCOL.md s6). Kotlin twin of
// OuraEvents.swift. Each carries the record's ringTimestamp (the ring-clock value; the app anchors it
// to UTC via the 0x42 time-sync / 0x85 RTC events) plus the decoded signal. Pure value types, no
// android.bluetooth.
//
// DIVERGENCE FROM SWIFT: Swift's UInt32 ringTimestamp becomes a Long holding the unsigned 32-bit
// value (0..0xFFFFFFFF), and Swift's Int64 epoch becomes Long. Values and layouts are identical.
//
// Per-sample timestamps inside a record (IBI/temp/HRV/SpO2) walk backward from the event time by each
// sample's own duration (OURA_PROTOCOL.md s6); to stay platform-pure and avoid baking a clock model
// into the decoders, the structs carry the raw ring/sample offsets and let the app's mapping layer
// apply the anchor. Honest-data invariant: a short/malformed record decodes to null upstream, so
// these structs only ever hold real decoded values.

 * field 0, index 11 for field 8); the rest are either plain bytes or a bare `byte<<1` with no carry.
 * NOOP's OWN investigation (2026-07-30, a 2661-pair real Gen 3 capture cross-correlated against the

 *
 * STRUCTURALLY VERIFIED on four consecutive real Gen 3 overnights (2026-08-05->09, 3,493 records): every
 * body is exactly 10 bytes; every record satisfies the source's own declared invariants
 * (`motionCount < 121`, `sleepState in {0,1,2}` - only 0 and 1 ever observed); every `breath` is an exact
 * multiple of 0.125, which confirms the `/8.0` fixed point FROM THE DATA rather than assuming it; and
 * `averageHrBpm` medians 53.0-54.0 bpm across the four nights, agreeing with the 54 bpm median the
 * independently-decoded banked-IBI channel gives for the same wearer (#511, itself WHOOP-validated
 * against RHR 55). The `* 0.5` scale is settled by its falsifier: read as `* 1.0` the same records sit
 * +56 ... +62 bpm above every other HR channel we hold.
 *
 * WHOSE measurement this is decides which bar applies. `breath` is computed BY THE RING and read off
 * the wire - it is not a signal NOOP derives from raw sensor data. The #194 rule is written for the
 * opposite case (PPG->HR autocorrelation, RSA-from-R-R: methods where NOOP invents the number and can
 * manufacture a peak that looks physiological), so what has to be right here is the DECODE, which is
 * what the structural verification above establishes. Same standing as the ring's own SleepNet
 * hypnogram, which NOOP already persists and scores from (#773 / #877).
 *
 * Independent support that byte 4 is the quantity Oura's own app calls respiratory rate: these records
 * median 14.75/min against the SAME wearer's 851-night Oura app export at 15.250 (IQR 14.875-15.625) -
 * same quantity, same band, though the two corpora do not overlap in date so this is a distribution
 * check, not a paired one. Against a WHOOP worn on the same nights the decode also reproduces the
 * VENDOR's own offset (Oura reads below WHOOP 18/18 nights, delta -1.158; ours delta -1.458,
 * sign-stable 6/6), and mapping each night to the wrong date collapses the agreement (r +0.591 ->
 * -0.151), so it is date-aligned rather than coincidental.
 *
 * It stays Tier B because the field NAMES come from third-party reverse engineering, not from Oura
 * documentation - a decode-provenance caveat, not a doubt about whether the ring measures respiration.
 *
 * `OuraStreamMapping` maps `breathsPerMin` - and nothing else from this record - to a `respSample` row
 * in milli-bpm under the ring's own deviceId, and `AnalyticsEngine` takes the night's median of those
 * rows as `dailyMetric.respRateBpm`: on a ring night that replaces an RSA-from-banked-R-R estimate which
 * carries no breathing information at all (shuffling the night returns the same 13.3333 bpm). The
 * baseline that value feeds is scoped to the current device era (`Baselines.deviceEraEpoch`, #459) so a
 * strap switch - WHOOP reads ~16.1, the ring ~14.6 - is not folded into one 28-day mean and read as
 * physiology. It still never reaches the sleep STAGER (`OuraRespScale.forScoring`): that stream is read
 * there as a ~1 Hz raw ADC waveform and a per-window rate is the wrong shape for a peak detector,
 * however good the rate. `averageHrBpm` stays diagnostic-only: it must not join the beat-derived HR
 * series at a different cadence and a different provenance.
 *

     * Byte-identical twin of Swift's envelopeRingTimestamp.

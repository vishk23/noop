/// End-to-end proof that the Rust archive in `Liters.xcframework` actually replicates a database,
/// rather than merely linking.
///
/// ## Why these tests open SQLite through `import SQLite3` and not GRDB
///
/// The single load-bearing decision in `Rust/Cargo.toml` is `default-features = false`, which makes
/// liters link the *platform* `libsqlite3` instead of compiling its own copy of the amalgamation.
/// The reason is that two SQLite libraries in one process do not share the process-global
/// `unixInodeInfo` table SQLite uses to work around POSIX's "close any descriptor, lose all locks"
/// rule, so either can silently drop the other's advisory locks — and liters' correctness rests on a
/// long-running read lock.
///
/// `import SQLite3` resolves to exactly the `libsqlite3.dylib` GRDB links through
/// `.systemLibrary(name: "CSQLite")`. So these tests are not a stand-in for the app's arrangement;
/// they *are* it: one process, one SQLite, opened from Swift on one side and from Rust on the other,
/// against the same file. A test written through GRDB would prove the same thing less directly and
/// drag a package dependency into a target that does not otherwise need one.
///
/// ## Why a real file and not an in-memory database
///
/// liters replicates WAL frames. An in-memory database has no WAL, no `-wal` sidecar, and no file
/// locks, so it would exercise none of the machinery under test and would pass whether or not the
/// linkage were correct.

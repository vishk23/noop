/**
 * Pure, JVM-testable mapping from the Oura ring's decoded [OuraEvent]s onto the datastore's
 * protocol [Streams] shape, so the WHOOP-isolated `OuraLiveSource` can persist its samples through
 * the SAME [WhoopRepository.insert] path (via [StreamPersistence.toBatch]) the WHOOP pipeline uses,
 * without duplicating row construction in the (untestable) app/BLE target. Kotlin twin of the Swift
 * `OuraStreamMapping` (WhoopStore), built from the architecture plan's section-4 table.
 *
 * HONEST-DATA INVARIANT (hard): we surface ONLY the ring's decoded raw signals and its OWN open
 * event tags. We never read or display Oura's encrypted readiness/sleep scores. NOOP computes its
 * own Charge/Rest downstream:
 *   - the IBI stream becomes [Streams.rr], from which RecoveryScorer reconstructs NOOP's OWN RMSSD;
 *   - the HR stream feeds resting-HR + strain;
 *   - the ring's open 0x5D HRV tag is recorded as an `OURA_HRV` diagnostic event carrying ITS RAW
 *     decoded fields (time_ms/b1/b2) ONLY, never a fabricated rmssd_ms (the int8 b1/b2 byte->ms
 *     scale is not Tier-A; NOOP's scoring RMSSD comes from `rr`, not this tag);
 *   - the open sleep-phase tags become `OURA_SLEEP_PHASE` events folded into a sleep session.
 *
 * Each event carries a ring-clock `ringTimestamp` (not wall-clock). To stay pure and avoid baking a
 * clock model in here, the caller supplies an [anchor] resolving a ring timestamp to wall-clock unix
 * seconds (driven by the ring's 0x42/0x85 time-sync events upstream). When the anchor cannot place a
 * record (anchor returns null), the sample is DROPPED rather than stamped with a guessed time
 * (honest-data invariant), a ts-less biometric row is unstorable anyway.

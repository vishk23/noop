/// ----------------------------
/// This coordinator is a deliberate **NO-OP for the single-WHOOP user** (one row, id "my-whoop",
/// `peripheralId` nil, no other device). That is the default state and EVERY state where no second
/// device is paired: WHOOP is active, `setPreferredPeripheral(nil)` keeps "connect to the first WHOOP
/// found", the WHOOP's deviceId stays "my-whoop", and the existing WHOOP flow (`BLEManager` via
/// `AppModel.scan(...)`) runs exactly as it does today. On a plain launch with one WHOOP it issues NO
/// scan, NO disconnect, NO re-point — the only side effect is one `setPreferredPeripheral(nil)`, which
/// is the BLEManager default and a no-op there.
///
/// It only ever *acts* beyond that when the registry has more than the seeded WHOOP:
///
///   • switching TO a generic strap → `stopWhoop()` (BLEManager's existing `disconnect()`), then
///     `start` the isolated `StandardHRSource` for that strap's deviceId.
///   • switching BACK to WHOOP     → `stop()` the `StandardHRSource`, re-point the WHOOP connection to
///     the now-active WHOOP, then `startWhoop()` (BLEManager's existing scan entry point).
///   • switching WHOOP → a DIFFERENT WHOOP → tear down the current WHOOP link, set its preferred
///     peripheral + active deviceId to the new WHOOP, and reconnect.
///
/// It never imports or references `BLEManager`: the WHOOP start/stop AND the WHOOP targeting hooks
/// (preferred peripheral, active deviceId) are injected closures from the app model, so the two BLE
/// flows stay fully decoupled (mirrors `StandardHRSource`'s isolation). The one input it observes off
/// the BLE engine — `connectedPeripheralUUID` — arrives as a plain publisher, not the manager itself.

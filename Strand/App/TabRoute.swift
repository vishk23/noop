// MARK: - TabRoute
//
// Value-based routes for every push that leaves a primary tab's ROOT (#198, Path A). The iOS tab
// shell binds each tab's `NavigationStack` to a `NavigationPath`, and a path only tracks pushes
// made through it — a closure-destination `NavigationLink` bypasses the path entirely. So the
// root-level links in the tab roots must push a VALUE for "re-tap the active tab" to pop back to
// the root (#135) without the #197 rebuild. Deeper links stay closure-based on purpose: popping a
// route off the path also pops everything pushed above it, so only the first hop needs a value.
//
// Shared with macOS because the tab roots (TodayView / LiquidTodayView / TrendsView) are the SAME
// views the sidebar shell hosts — every `NavigationStack` that hosts one must register
// `tabRouteDestinations()`, and must register it exactly ONCE: the same value type resolving
// against two registrations in one stack double-pushes (see MetricExplorerView, #38).

/// One first-hop destination reachable from a tab root. `Hashable` so it can ride a `NavigationPath`.

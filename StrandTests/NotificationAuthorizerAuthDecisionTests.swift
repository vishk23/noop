/// the switch can't silently start re-prompting an already-answered user (`.deny` case) or stop
/// asking a genuinely undetermined one (`.mustAsk` case). This is the seam that was missing before
/// the fix: every notifier in the app used to inline this switch inside a `getNotificationSettings`
/// closure, which needs a live `UNUserNotificationCenter` round-trip to exercise at all. The
/// authorization round-trip itself and actual notification delivery remain device/OS-only and are
/// not covered here — see the PR description.

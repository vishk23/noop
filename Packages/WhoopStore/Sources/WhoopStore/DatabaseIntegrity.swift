/// The `.noopbak` import already gates on the 16-byte SQLite magic and on the migrator's
/// bookkeeping table (`grdb_migrations` / `room_master_table`), but BOTH of those live in the first
/// pages of the file: a backup that was truncated mid-upload, torn by a dying SD card, or clipped by
/// a cloud-sync client still passes them — and then "restores" into a store that silently shows no
/// data, which is exactly the #1014 report (our #1000 settings code was exonerated; the file itself
/// was the suspect). The missing armour is SQLite's own verdict: `PRAGMA quick_check` walks the page
/// structure and catches malformed pages, truncation ("size is N pages but the header says M"), and
/// bad cell layouts. `quick_check` (not `integrity_check`) deliberately skips index-content
/// verification so it stays proportionate on a 100 MB+ library while still refusing every
/// structurally damaged file.
///
/// Lives in the package — not the app's `DataBackup` — for the same reason `BackupSettings` does:
/// the verdict is pure SQLite + string logic, so it is unit-testable headlessly
/// (`swift test --filter DatabaseIntegrityTests`) against real damaged files. The Android
/// `DataBackup.quickCheckVerdict` mirrors `verdict(fromRows:)` byte-for-byte on the same golden
/// vectors, so both platforms agree on what "healthy" means.

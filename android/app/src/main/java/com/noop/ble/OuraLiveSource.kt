/**
 * EXPERIMENTAL, ISOLATED live-BLE source for the Oura ring (gen3 / gen4 / gen5).
 *
 * Faithful Kotlin twin of Strand/BLE/OuraLiveSource.swift. This replaced an earlier honest dead-end
 * probe: where that probe only proved "there's no OPEN stream", this transport speaks the
 * ring's OWN documented protocol (clean-room, see docs/OURA_PROTOCOL.md) to authenticate with the
 * 16-byte application key, enable the daytime-HR feature, and decode the ring's RAW signals
 * (HR / IBI / RMSSD / SpO2 / skin-temp / sleep-phase tags). NOOP computes its OWN Charge/Rest from
 * those raw signals; the ring's encrypted readiness/sleep SCORES are never read or surfaced
 * (honest-data invariant).
 *
 * All BLE specifics live here; all protocol specifics live in the JVM-pure [OuraDriver] (which holds
 * NO BluetoothGatt). This class owns the transport and feeds the driver only bytes + transition events.
 *
 * WHOOP-FIRST ISOLATION (identical to [StandardHrSource] / [HuamiHrSource]): this class runs its OWN
 * scan + [BluetoothGatt] and never imports, calls, or shares state with the WHOOP BLE client. The
 * WHOOP path cannot regress because of anything here. The only shared surfaces are injected closures:
 *   - [liveSink]  pushes the ring's live HR (bpm) + R-R (ms) into whatever the UI observes (the
 *                 [SourceCoordinator] wires it to the same live state a WHOOP/strap reading uses).
 *   - [persist]   wired by the app to `repository.insert(StreamBatch, deviceId)` for the active ring.
 *   - [log]       the SAME exportable strap log (issue #421); every line is prefixed "Oura: ".
 *   - [onBattery] surfaces the ring's battery percent the same place a strap's does.
 *
 * HONEST FALLBACK (Huami precedent): when no install key is available ([authKey] returns null) or the
 * ring reports it is in factory reset, the ring needs a pairing/provisioning handshake the live flow
 * does not silently perform. This source then publishes an HONEST message via [needsPairing] and stays
 * disconnected from data - it NEVER fabricates a reading and never displays Oura's own scores.
 *
 * Android runtime-permission notes (same contract as the other sources): the caller must hold
 * BLUETOOTH_SCAN + BLUETOOTH_CONNECT before [scan]/[connect]. Every android.bluetooth call is
 * @SuppressLint("MissingPermission") - the caller owns the grant.

/// `OuraLiveSource.shouldSuspendLiveHR` — when the live-HR re-engage stands down because nobody is looking.
///
/// The decision is a pure static precisely so it can be tested: `OuraLiveSource` owns a
/// `CBCentralManager` and cannot be constructed in a unit test. These tests pin the decision only. That suspending the re-engage actually lets the ring run its own night suite is a STRAP
/// claim — it needs an overnight capture showing `check_sleep` reaching a run and `DHR_mode` leaving 3 —
/// and is called out as owed in the PR body, not asserted here.
///
/// Why the rule exists: across 10 nights the correlation between our overnight re-engage count and the ring
/// running its night suite is r = -0.91, but both of the nights that broke the pattern also broke the LINK
/// (one disconnect, one phone deliberately out of range), confounding "we stopped poking the ring" with "we
/// stopped talking to the ring at all". Suspending the re-engage while staying connected is what separates
/// them.

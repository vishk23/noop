//      outlier rejection, and Winsor clamping. This is `update`/`foldHistory`.
//   2. Trailing-window mean/SD (the task's "trailing 30-day mean/SD"): a simple,

    // outlier gate then REJECTED the user's genuine LOWER nights (a true 54ms vs an anchored ~85ms
    // baseline is >5× the floor spread → "seen but not folded"); (c) the still-tight spread made
    // the z-score hypersensitive, crushing Charge to 1-2.

    // the center down quickly, THEN settle to the normal long-term smoothing.

    //     OR while spread is still at the floor — so legitimate lower nights are never discarded
    //     before the spread has had a chance to widen to reflect them.

    //     days, not weeks, before relaxing back to halfLifeB.

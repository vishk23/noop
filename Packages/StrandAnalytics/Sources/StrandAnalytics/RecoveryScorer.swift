// RecoveryScorer.swift — resting HR during sleep + a transparent 0–100 recovery score.
//
// Ported from server/ingest/app/analysis/recovery.py.
//
// recovery() is a z-score + logistic composite. It is APPROXIMATE — not
// WHOOP-identical (WHOOP's model is proprietary). It is a transparent,
// HRV-dominant, baseline-normalized proxy.
//
// Weighting (documented, grounded, explainable; this is "Charge" in the UI):
//   higher HRV vs baseline       → higher recovery  (W_HRV       = 0.55, dominant)
//   lower resting HR vs baseline → higher recovery  (W_RHR       = 0.20)
//   higher rest quality (sleep)  → higher recovery  (W_SLEEP     = 0.15)
//   lower resp vs baseline       → higher recovery  (W_RESP      = 0.05)
//   skin-temp deviation from 0   → lower recovery   (W_SKIN_TEMP = 0.05)
//
// The Charge/Effort/Rest redesign folds skin temperature in (illness/overreach
// signal): HRV dropped 0.60 → 0.55 to make room for W_SKIN_TEMP = 0.05. The
// skin-temp term is a SYMMETRIC penalty on the ±°C deviation (−|dev|/scale), so any
// drift away from the personal baseline — hot or cold — lowers Charge. It is added
// ONLY when a skin-temp deviation is supplied; when nil the term drops and the
// weights renormalize, leaving the no-skin-temp score IDENTICAL to before.
//
// Two more OPTIONAL, nil-default terms close the gap to Oura Readiness's 8 contributors (an
// Oura-reference validation found Charge already tracks Oura's readiness at r≈0.71; these are
// the two components Charge lacked):
//   overnight resting-HR DECLINE slope ("Recovery Index")      → W_RECOVERY_INDEX    = 0.05
//   previous-day Effort vs personal baseline ("Activity Balance" /
//   "Previous Day Activity", collapsed into one term)          → W_ACTIVITY_BALANCE  = 0.05
// Both are ADDITIVE and NON-BREAKING: each is nil unless the caller supplies it, in which case
// it folds in with its small weight above; when nil the term drops and the weights renormalize
// exactly like the skin-temp term, so the default score for every existing caller is
// BYTE-IDENTICAL to before either term existed. Recovery Index needs no personal baseline (a
// fixed, documented bpm/hour scale, same style as sleepPerf/skin-temp); Activity Balance needs
// BOTH the previous-day Effort value AND its EWMA baseline (`Baselines.strainCfg`) — supplying
// only one drops the term.
//
// Each metric is standardized to a robust z-score against the personal baseline
// (mean + EWMA-abs-dev spread). Missing terms are dropped and the weights
// renormalized. The composite z is squashed through a logistic anchored so that
// Z = 0 → ~58% (WHOOP's published population-average recovery).
//
// Cold-start: if the HRV baseline (dominant driver) is not yet usable
// (< MIN_NIGHTS_SEED valid nights), recovery() returns nil. Callers may use
// RECOVERY_POPULATION_MEAN (58.0) as a fallback but should flag it.

    // MARK: - Parasympathetic-saturation guard (Charge): DETECTED AND LOGGED, NOT APPLIED
    //
    // A low nightly HRV is normally a fatigue signal, so the HRV term (wHRV = 0.55, the dominant
    // driver) pulls Charge DOWN. There is a CANDIDATE benign pattern the raw z-score may mis-read:
    // parasympathetic (vagal) saturation. In a very fit or very relaxed state the RMSSD-HRV response
    // can saturate and read LOW while resting HR reads LOW too, and the two DECOUPLE. On such a night
    // the dominant HRV penalty tanks Charge even though the person is well rested.
    //
    // The candidate discriminator is the SIGN of the resting-HR term versus the HRV term. recovery()
    // builds the HRV term as (hrv - mu)/sigma (NEGATIVE when HRV is below baseline = the penalty) and
    // the RHR term as (mu - rhr)/sigma (POSITIVE when resting HR is below baseline = recovery-good). In
    // a normally-coupled autonomic response a low HRV travels WITH a HIGH resting HR (sympathetic
    // drive), so both terms point the SAME way (down). When instead the HRV term points "bad" while the
    // resting-HR term points "good", the expected HRV<->RHR coupling has broken.
    //
    // ── WHY THE EASING IS COMPUTED BUT DELIBERATELY NOT APPLIED ─────────────────────────────────
    //
    // This code DETECTS the signature and REPORTS the easing it would apply, but `recovery(...)` does
    // NOT consume it: the Charge number is byte-identical to pre-guard behaviour. Two reasons, both
    // currently unresolved:
    //
    //   1. VALIDATION GAP. The real-data validation behind this guard recorded ZERO firings over ~2
    //      weeks. That is evidence the gate does not OVER-fire; it is NOT evidence that the easing is
    //      the right size, or right at all, on a real saturation night, because no real saturation
    //      night was ever observed. Every night that would actually move Charge is covered by
    //      synthetic fixtures only (see RecoverySaturationGuardTests).
    //   2. CONTESTED PREMISE. Low HRV + low resting HR is ALSO a reported signature of parasympathetic
    //      (non-functional) OVERREACHING, which is genuinely maladaptive. From the HRV/RHR pair alone,
    //      benign saturation and overreaching are not distinguishable, and they want OPPOSITE Charge
    //      corrections. Easing the penalty on an overreaching night would hide a real problem.
    //
    // So the guard ships INSTRUMENT-FIRST: detection is live and surfaces in the Charge trace (the
    // "charge saturation active ... wouldRaiseCharge=N" line) and in the ChargeDrivers HRV verdict, so
    // real low-HRV + low-RHR nights accumulate and can be checked against ground truth. Enabling the
    // easing is a follow-up gated on confirmed real firings, not on the synthetic fixtures.
    //
    // TO ENABLE LATER: feed `easedHrvZ` into the HRV term at the marked call site in `recovery(...)`,
    // and flip the tests that currently pin the score as UNCHANGED.

    /// Personal-sigma units BOTH the low-HRV arm and the low-resting-HR arm must clear before the
    /// guard engages. 0.5 sigma keeps it OFF marginal / noise nights: a night must be clearly low on

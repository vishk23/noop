// MARK: - LiveSessionRunner
//
// The transport half of Live Sessions (silent guardian): the pure `LiveSessionEngine` decides WHAT
// should happen; this object is the only place that touches a clock, the live HR stream, the strap
// buzz and the store. One 1 Hz timer feeds the engine `LiveState.heartRate` (or nil, so the engine
// can detect a quiet stream itself — no liveness guessing here), publishes each `Output` for the
// session screen, walks a cue's pulse list out through the EXISTING hardware buzz, and books the
// session into the `liveSession` table (once at start with endTs nil, once at end with the totals).
//
// Design contract: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-04-live-sessions-design.md. Session-scoped: the
// view owns one runner per presentation (@StateObject), so `start` runs once and a finished runner
// is never restarted.
//
// Honesty rules carried over from the engine:
//   • Nothing here invents a number — the published `Output` is the engine's, verbatim.
//   • A cue that can't be delivered cleanly is DROPPED, never queued: a late buzz is a wrong buzz.
//   • Ten minutes of continuous stale ends the session on its own — guarding a dead stream is a lie.

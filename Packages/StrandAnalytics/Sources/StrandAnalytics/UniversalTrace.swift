// UniversalTrace.swift - the lines that ride EVERY Test Centre export, not only in Connection mode.
//
// The dayOwner line (built in the app's IntelligenceEngine) already rides every export tagged `.universal`.
// This adds the strap CLOCK-DRIFT + firmware-layout picture to that universal block so the RTC cluster
// (#531 / #767 / #804 / #812) self-diagnoses on every export. Previously the clock-drift summary was only
// emitted while the Connection test mode was on (BLEManager, gated on TestCentre.active(.connection)), so a
// Sleep or Battery report from a clock-broken strap never carried the one line that explains the failure.
// Hoisting it to the universal block means ANY active mode surfaces it.
//
// Pure + side-effect-free: no clock read of its own, no I/O. The caller (the export assembler) passes the
// last strap-reported banked-record window and its own wall-now; this formats one line. No PII (ISO dates,
// counts and a firmware version int only). No em-dashes. Android's universal clock diagnostic is built by
// `ConnectionTrace.clockDriftLine` and emitted by `WhoopBleClient`; its firmware-layout line is separate,
// emitted by `Backfiller` only in Connection mode. Android has no single `UniversalTrace` declaration that
// combines them.

    /// FUTURE-DATE flag (the tell of a wandering / un-clocked RTC), the optional banked span in days, and the
    /// firmware record-layout version the strap hands over. One line, tagged `.universal` by the caller, so
    /// every export self-diagnoses the clock/firmware state behind the #531/#767/#804/#812 cluster.
    ///
    /// All timestamps are unix seconds in the same wall domain (the BLE layer decodes oldest/newest from the
    /// strap's GET_DATA_RANGE reply and the caller passes its own wall-now), so the future test is a plain
    /// comparison. `oldestUnix` is optional (a short range reply gives only the upper bound). `firmwareLayout`
    /// is the historical record-layout version (18/24/25/26) the strap emits, or nil when not yet observed
    /// this session; it is reported as "v<n>" or "unknown" so the line is always firmware-aware.
    ///
    /// - Parameter futureToleranceSeconds: slack before flagging FUTURE; a strap RTC vs phone skew of a
    ///   minute or two is normal, so the default mirrors a couple of minutes.
    /// - Parameter behindToleranceSeconds: slack before flagging a BEHIND drift (#990) - a newest banked
    ///   record naturally trails wall time by hours, so the default is 48 h; beyond that "clockOk" was a
    ///   false all-clear (a -363 d drift used to read clockOk).

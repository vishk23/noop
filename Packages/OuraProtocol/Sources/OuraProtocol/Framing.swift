// Framing: the two framing layers that ride on the same characteristics (OURA_PROTOCOL.md s2).
//   - Outer command / command-response frame:  op(1) len(1) body(len)        (s2.1)
//   - Extended / secure-session frame (0x2F):   2F len subop subop-body       (s2.2)
//   - Inner event record (TLV):                 type(1) len(1) rt:u32LE payload (s2.3)
// All multi-byte integers are little-endian unless a decoder states otherwise (OURA_PROTOCOL.md s2.1).
//
// The first byte disambiguates layers: a value present in the opcode table (s4) is an outer frame;
// otherwise it is an inner event record. The OuraDriver routes on this; Framing exposes pure parsers
// plus a defensive Reassembler that buffers partial trailing bytes across notifications (s2.4).
//
// Platform-pure, value types only. Facts cited per OURA_PROTOCOL.md s2.

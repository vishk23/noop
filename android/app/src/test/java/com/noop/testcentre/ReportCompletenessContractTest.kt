/**
 * Contract + behaviour test for the report-completeness guard.
 *
 * NOT a parity test, despite what this file was called until #1531 exposed the difference. It pins the
 * Kotlin {domain -> killer-token} map against literals held HERE; it never reads the Swift side, so it
 * cannot fail when the two platforms drift -- and it stayed green through a divergence in which three of
 * the ten tokens ended up with no Swift counterpart at all (import, steps, battery). Claiming otherwise
 * was worse than claiming nothing, because it invited a reader to trust a guarantee that did not exist.
 *
 * What it DOES guarantee is still worth having: that Android's own map, section ordering and
 * present/MISSING wording cannot change by accident. Identical tokens across platforms are neither the
 * contract nor achievable -- each side must key on the lines its own emitters write. See
 * ReportCompleteness's header for the per-domain breakdown.

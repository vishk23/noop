//      outlier rejection, and Winsor clamping. This is `update`/`foldHistory`.
//   2. Trailing-window mean/SD (the task's "trailing 30-day mean/SD"): a simple,
//      auditable rolling mean and sample SD over the trailing N valid nights.
//      This is `rollingMeanSD`. Useful for explainability and cross-checking.
//
// Both produce a `BaselineState` so RecoveryScorer can consume either uniformly.

    // HIGH (a common cold-start artefact), three things compounded to lock the baseline high for
    // ~2-3 weeks: (a) the seed fixed the mean high while spread sat at the floor; (b) the hard
    // outlier gate then REJECTED the user's genuine LOWER nights (a true 54ms vs an anchored ~85ms
    // baseline is >5× the floor spread → "seen but not folded"); (c) the still-tight spread made
    // the z-score hypersensitive, crushing Charge to 1-2.
    //
    // The fix is conservative and principled: during the baseline's EARLY life let reality pull
    // the center down quickly, THEN settle to the normal long-term smoothing.
    //   - Skip the hard-outlier rejection while the baseline is young (nValid below the threshold)
    //     OR while spread is still at the floor — so legitimate lower nights are never discarded
    //     before the spread has had a chance to widen to reflect them.
    //   - Use a faster effective center half-life for the first few nights so it tracks reality in
    //     days, not weeks, before relaxing back to halfLifeB.
    //   - Widen the effective spread used for Winsor clamping during early life so an honest lower
    //     night isn't clamped flat against a floor-tight band.

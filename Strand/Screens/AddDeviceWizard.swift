// MARK: - Add a device — guided, branching wizard
//
// Different bands pair COMPLETELY differently, so this wizard asks the device TYPE first, then gives
// type-specific prep guidance and runs the RIGHT scan/connect for that type:
//
//   • WHOOP 4.0 / WHOOP 5.0 (MG)  → BLEManager's present-scan (`scanForWhoops`), targeted at the
//     chosen WHOOP family via `model.presentWhoopScan(model:)`. Lists nearby straps from
//     `ble.discoveredWhoops` (a present-only mode that never auto-connects).
//   • Heart-rate strap (Polar / Wahoo / Coospo / Garmin HRM / Amazfit Helio broadcast) → its OWN
//     isolated `StandardHRSource` scanning the standard 0x180D HR service. Lists from `discovered`.
//
// Registration goes through `model.registerDevice(_:makeActive:)` → DeviceRegistry; the
// SourceCoordinator reacts to the active-device change and connects. The wizard never touches
// BLEManager directly — only the AppModel pass-throughs. WHOOP-FIRST: WHOOP is the primary band; the
// type list shows it first and a footer reiterates it. Renders cleanly with nothing nearby (the type
// picker, every prep step, and the searching/empty pick state all need no hardware).

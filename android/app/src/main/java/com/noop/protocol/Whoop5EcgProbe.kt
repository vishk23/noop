/**
 * Kotlin twin of Swift `Whoop5EcgProbe`: formats the WHOOP MG ECG ("Labrador") turn-on attempt into one
 * readable, copyable report — the per-command COMMAND_RESPONSE result codes, whether any ECG-shaped
 * packet actually arrived, and a verdict that describes WHAT THE RUN OBSERVED rather than naming a
 * mechanism behind it.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic, so the JVM unit tests cover it with no strap.
 *
 * The Android client has no ECG app layer to drive this — it takes the decoder ([Whoop5Ecg]) only. It is
 * mirrored anyway because the classification below decides how a null result gets reported, which is the
 * claim this probe exists to make; a rule that important is worth two independent implementations and
 * two test suites, and both suites pin the same runs.
 *
 * ## The verdicts name observations, not mechanisms
 *
 * An earlier version of this type reported a silent run as *"consistent with a device-flag block applied
 * as a silent no-op"* and a refusal as `BlockedByDeviceFlagsLikely`. **Both named a mechanism this probe
 * cannot observe and the protocol does not carry.** `blockedByDeviceFlags` is a CLIENT-SIDE construct: it
 * is never transmitted to a strap, no command in `whoop_protocol.json`'s `CommandNumber` table reads or
 * writes such a flag, and nothing in this repo implements one. It is not a strap capability gate, so a
 * probe that only ever sees result codes and packet counts is in no position to attribute silence to it.
 *
 * That mattered in practice. #891 tested the leading named candidate for a firmware-side gate
 * (`enable_raw_data_w_ecg`, written to `'1'` and read back through `GET_DEVICE_CONFIG_VALUE(121)`) and
 * still got zero packets in 30 s with the electrodes held — so the flag-block reading is not where the
 * evidence points, and it was the probe's own wording that kept lending it weight. Five other
 * explanations fit the same silence: banked to flash rather than streamed, a wrong opcode mapping, no
 * actual start verb among three `TOGGLE_*` commands, an entitlement gate, or an electrode circuit that
 * never closed.
 *
 * So the three signals below are reported as themselves, and the report states which one fired:
 *
 *  1. `UNSUPPORTED(3)` — the firmware does not implement the opcode at all. A different, and more final,
 *     answer than a refusal.
 *  2. `FAILURE(0)` — the firmware KNOWS the opcode and REFUSES to run it. That is a fact about the
 *     opcode; WHY it refused is not on the wire.
 *  3. `SUCCESS(1)` on every command, but ZERO ECG packets across the capture window — acknowledged and
 *     then not honoured. It does not identify what suppressed them.
 *
 * Nothing is ever inferred from silence alone: no reply at all is reported as exactly that, because an
 * in-flight sync or a dropped notification produces the same silence.
 *
 * ## What a run has to contain before silence means anything
 *
 * Signal 3 reads SILENCE as evidence. Silence only carries information when the run actually **asked the
 * strap for data**: a wrist selection changes no data path, and the OFF sequence asks for the silence it
 * gets. So every step records whether the command — *with the argument it was sent with* — could have
 * produced realtime ECG data ([Whoop5Ecg.requestsRealtimeData]), and the two verdicts that interpret
 * silence are unreachable without one:
 *
 *  - [Verdict.AcceptedButSilent] needs a data request that came back `SUCCESS`. Requested-but-
 *    unacknowledged is [Verdict.DataRequestNotAccepted]; nothing requested at all is
 *    [Verdict.NoDataRequested].
 *  - [Verdict.DataRequestRefused] needs the refused command to be a data request. A `FAILURE` on
 *    a configuration write is [Verdict.CommandRefused] — the firmware refused *that write*, which is a
 *    fact about that opcode and not about whether ECG generation is gated.
 *
 * Both defects were live: a `SELECT_WRIST`-only run on a WHOOP 5 MG rendered "Accepted but SILENT …
 * consistent with a device-flag block" having sent no data-generation command at all, and a second
 * `SELECT_WRIST`-only run that came back `FAILURE` rendered "LIKELY blockedByDeviceFlags". Both
 * manufactured evidence for hypothesis (e) of #891 out of runs that could not speak to it.

     *
     * The packet TYPE byte the Labrador records arrive under is NOT attested, so the probe hunts for it

     * exactly what a hardcoded 2-bytes-per-sample length agreement did to every 3-byte frame before
     * [Whoop5Ecg.FILTERED_WIDTH_CANDIDATES] widened it.
     *
     * It makes no claim about anything it records: it is a census, and every line in it is a frame the
     * probe could not classify.
     *
     * ## Bounds
     *
     * At most [MAX_SAMPLES_PER_TYPE] recorded frames per distinct type byte and [MAX_TYPES] distinct type
     * bytes. Everything past a cap is COUNTED, never silently dropped.
     *
     * The Kotlin twin of the Swift `Whoop5EcgProbe.FrameCensus`. Android has no ECG app layer to feed it —
     * nothing on this platform sends the Labrador commands — so this exists for parity and is covered by
     * its own tests, exactly like the rest of this file.

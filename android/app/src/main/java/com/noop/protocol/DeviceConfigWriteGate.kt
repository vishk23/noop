/**
 * #891 / #103: the ONE device-config key this app may write beyond the Broadcast-HR flag —
 * `enable_raw_data_w_ecg` — and the key-aware allowlist that keeps every other key off the wire.
 *
 * ## Where the key came from
 *
 * The strap listed it itself. `START_DEVICE_CONFIG_KEY_EXCHANGE(115)` + `SEND_NEXT_DEVICE_CONFIG(116)` —
 * the read-only enumeration pair [ConfigKeySweep] builds — was answered by a WHOOP 5 MG with
 * `revision=1 count=7`, and the walk ran to a clean `index=255 validKey=false` terminator listing:
 *
 * ```
 * sigproc_wear_detect            enable_rfid                    max_collection_backlog
 * cont_collection_mode           whoop_live_hr_in_adv_ind_pkt   whoop_live_2_hrm_devices
 * enable_raw_data_w_ecg
 * ```
 *
 * Six of those seven were unknown to this codebase. Nothing here is guessed: the names are the strap's
 * own, read off its own enumeration.
 *
 * ## Why this key, and why now
 *
 * #891 records that all three TOGGLE_LABRADOR (ECG) commands — 139, 125, 124 — answer `SUCCESS(1)` on a
 * WHOOP 5 MG and produce **zero** ECG packets in a 30-second listen. What the echoed byte those replies
 * carry actually MEANS is still open: arg-echo is refuted (SELECT_WRIST was sent 0 and answered 1) and
 * blanket payload-echo is refuted (GET_BATTERY_LEVEL sends `[0x00]` and answers 0x2F), but "read-back of
 * stored state" remains an inference — a per-opcode handler echoing a constant fits every observation so
 * far just as well. Either way the practical lesson holds: a `SUCCESS` result byte is not evidence that
 * state changed.
 *
 * On the same strap `enable_raw_data_w_ecg` reads `'0'`. A device-config key whose name pairs "raw data"
 * with "ecg", sitting at `'0'` on a strap whose ECG toggles accept and emit nothing, is the leading
 * candidate for the gate. **Whether flipping it actually produces ECG data is UNKNOWN.** A negative result
 * — gate flipped to `'1'`, read back as `'1'`, still no packets — is a publishable answer that removes the
 * leading hypothesis from #891, and is the outcome this path is built to establish either way.
 *
 * ## Why a write is safe to offer at all
 *
 * Config writes on this firmware are demonstrated, not assumed: running the existing `enable_r22_*`
 * sequence (#174) moved `enable_sig12` from `'2'` (0x32) to `'1'` (0x31), confirmed by a 121 read before
 * and after. So a `SET_DEVICE_CONFIG_VALUE(119)` write lands, and the value that comes back afterwards is
 * real rather than an echo of what was sent.
 *
 * ## Read-back is the proof, not the ack
 *
 * The write's own `COMMAND_RESPONSE` is **not** treated as evidence. #891 is the standing example of why:
 * `SELECT_WRIST` returns SUCCESS for a no-op and FAILURE for a real change, so a result byte says nothing
 * reliable about whether state moved. Every write from this path is therefore followed by a
 * `GET_DEVICE_CONFIG_VALUE(121)` read of the same key, and only the value that comes back is reported.
 * (Framing owed to @ryanbr on #891.)
 *
 * ## The allowlist is key-aware, not just opcode-aware
 *
 * Opcode 119 is shared: the Broadcast-HR flag (#181) writes through it too. An opcode-only allowlist
 * therefore cannot express "this key and no other", and before this file the 5/MG send path admitted ANY
 * device-config key while the Broadcast-HR opt-in happened to be on. [admitsSend] closes that: it parses
 * the key name out of the body and admits exactly two keys, each only while its OWN opt-in is on. The five
 * remaining enumerated keys are named in [OUT_OF_SCOPE_KEYS] and are refused unconditionally — their
 * effects are unknown and nothing here has any reason to move them.
 *
 * This is the same discipline [DeviceConfigReadProbe.isReadOnlyOpcode] established for the read probes: a
 * single pure predicate that the BLE send path itself consults, so a unit test proving the predicate
 * rejects something is proving it about the real wire path and not about a parallel copy of the rule.
 *
 * Pure: no Android BLE, no I/O, no preferences. The caller supplies the two opt-in booleans. Twin of the
 * Swift `DeviceConfigWriteGate` — keep them byte-identical.

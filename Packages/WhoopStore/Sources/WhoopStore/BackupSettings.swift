/// The `settings.json` payload inside a `.noopbak` backup (#1000).
///
/// A `.noopbak` is a ZIP whose first entry is the SQLite database. That round-trips every row, but the
/// user's profile (age / sex / weight / height / HR-max override) and display preferences live in
/// UserDefaults (SharedPreferences on Android), so a restore onto a fresh device silently reset them —
/// the "restore doesn't bring back settings/weight/height" half of #1000. This adds a SECOND, optional
/// ZIP entry — `settings.json`, a flat JSON object — carrying exactly one WHITELISTED set of keys.
///
/// The whitelist is the contract, defined once per platform and mirrored byte-for-byte by Android's
/// `BackupSettingsCodec` (same canonical key strings, same JSON kinds). Only stable, user-set,
/// non-device-specific values are allowed. NEVER add device ids, peripheral ids, tokens, sync cursors,
/// or anything anonymity-sensitive: backups get copied into cloud folders and attached to GitHub
/// issues, so this file must stay safe to share. Unknown keys in an incoming `settings.json` are
/// dropped on the floor; a backup with no `settings.json` (every pre-#1000 backup) is simply a
/// DB-only restore, exactly as before.
///
/// Pure JSON + UserDefaults mapping only — no ZIP code here. The container work stays in the app's
/// `DataBackup`; this lives in the package so the codec and the defaults round-trip are unit-testable
/// headlessly (`swift test --filter BackupSettingsTests`).

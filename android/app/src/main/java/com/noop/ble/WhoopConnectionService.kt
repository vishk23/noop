/**
 * Foreground service that keeps the WHOOP BLE connection alive while the app is backgrounded or
 * closed.
 *
 * Android tears a process down shortly after its last Activity goes away, which is exactly why
 * people on Reddit saw the strap disconnect the moment they closed NOOP. A started foreground
 * service — with an ongoing notification — keeps the process (and therefore the
 * [com.noop.NoopApplication]-owned [WhoopBleClient] and its GATT link) resident, so heart rate
 * keeps streaming and offloads keep landing in the background.
 *
 * It does **not** own or drive the connection: it simply holds the process up and mirrors the
 * client's [LiveState] into the notification. Start/stop is gated by a Settings toggle (see
 * `NoopPrefs.backgroundConnection`) and only ever happens from the foreground (on connect / when
 * the user flips the toggle), so we never trip Android 12+'s background-start restriction.
 *
 * The matching capability on macOS is free: `AppModel` is an app-level `@StateObject` kept alive by
 * the menu-bar extra, so closing the window leaves the strap connected.

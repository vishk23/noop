/// `StrapChargeInference` — the charging state the app is willing to stand behind.
///
/// The bug: a 5/MG on its charging puck reported `battery_charging = 0` while its SoC climbed, so the app
/// stated "not charging" and showed a "~2 days left" DISCHARGE estimate to a user watching it charge. The
/// 5.0 charge bit's offset (@30) is unverified — the decoder's own docs confirm only the SoC and mV fields
/// against a real capture — so the bit alone is not a fact worth reporting.
///
/// ⚠️ THESE TESTS PASSING DOES NOT MEAN THE INFERENCE WORKS. Every fixture below steps the SoC by far
/// more than the 1.0 pp `isRising` demands, so they exercise the decision but NOT the magnitude a real
/// charge actually produces. Mirror data (2026-07-26) shows a confirmed charge stepping +0.3…+0.7 pp per
/// reading at a ~30 s cadence — under the threshold throughout, i.e. the inference would never fire on
/// it. See the KNOWN ISSUE block on `StrapChargeInference` and §A6 of
/// docs/bugs/2026-07-15-strap-battery-backfill-observability.md. A fix wants a real-cadence regression
/// case here, not just a smaller number in these fixtures.

/**
 * #1545: why a day produced no workout, counted at each gate the detector actually applies.
 *
 * The `effort bout` line explains a bout that EXISTS, so it is silent on the harder report — a strap log
 * with 37 days and zero detected workouts, where every gate looks equally plausible from outside. These
 * tests pin that the funnel separates the causes rather than just confirming the zero.
 *
 * Byte-parity twin of Swift `DetectionFunnelTests`.

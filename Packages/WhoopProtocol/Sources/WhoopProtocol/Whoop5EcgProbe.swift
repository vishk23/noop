/// Formats the WHOOP MG ECG ("Labrador") turn-on attempt into one readable, copyable report — the
/// per-command COMMAND_RESPONSE result codes, whether any ECG-shaped packet actually arrived, and the
/// verdict on the ONE gating question the client cannot answer: whether the strap's firmware
/// `WhoopDeviceFlag` layer returns `blockedByDeviceFlags` for this feature.
///
/// Pure + deterministic, so `swift test` covers it with no strap. Structurally the twin of
/// `BodyLocationProbe` / `ExtendedBatteryProbe`.
///
/// Mirrored in Kotlin as `com.noop.protocol.Whoop5EcgProbe` even though the Android client has no ECG
/// app layer to drive it. The classification below decides whether a null result gets reported as
/// evidence of a firmware block, which is the claim this probe exists to make — a rule that important
/// is worth two independent implementations and two test suites, and both suites pin the same runs.
///
/// ## How the block is detected
///
/// The client-side gates are known and satisfiable: the hardware gate is `gen5MG` (non-bypassable, and
/// an MG owner satisfies it), while the entitlement and feature-flag gates live entirely in the app.
/// The remaining unknown is a FIRMWARE gate, so it can only be answered by what the strap does. Three
/// signals separate the cases, and the report states which one fired:
///
///   1. `UNSUPPORTED(3)` — the firmware does not implement the opcode at all. Not a flag block; a
///      different (and more final) answer.
///   2. `FAILURE(0)` — the firmware KNOWS the opcode and REFUSES to run it. That is the single-frame
///      signature most consistent with a device-flag block, and the strongest evidence a one-shot probe
///      can produce.
///   3. `SUCCESS(1)` on every command, but ZERO ECG packets across the capture window — a silent
///      no-op: acknowledged and then not honoured. Also consistent with a flag block, and the reason
///      this probe counts arriving packets instead of trusting the acks.
///
/// A block is never inferred from silence alone: no reply at all is reported as exactly that, because
/// an in-flight sync or a dropped notification produces the same silence.
///
/// ## What a run has to contain before silence means anything
///
/// Signal 3 above reads SILENCE as evidence. Silence only carries information when the run actually
/// **asked the strap for data**: a wrist selection changes no data path, and the OFF sequence asks for
/// the silence it gets. So every step records whether the command — *with the argument it was sent
/// with* — could have produced realtime ECG data (`Whoop5Ecg.requestsRealtimeData`), and the two
/// verdicts that interpret silence are unreachable without one:
///
/// - `acceptedButSilent` needs a data request that came back `SUCCESS`. Requested-but-unacknowledged is
///   `dataRequestNotAccepted`; nothing requested at all is `noDataRequested`.
/// - `blockedByDeviceFlagsLikely` needs the refused command to be a data request. A `FAILURE` on a
///   configuration write is reported as `commandRefused` — the firmware refused *that write*, which is
///   a fact about that opcode and not about whether ECG generation is gated.
///
/// Both defects were live: a `SELECT_WRIST`-only run on a WHOOP 5 MG rendered "Accepted but SILENT …
/// consistent with a device-flag block" having sent no data-generation command at all, and a second
/// `SELECT_WRIST`-only run that came back `FAILURE` rendered "LIKELY blockedByDeviceFlags". Both
/// manufactured evidence for hypothesis (e) of #891 out of runs that could not speak to it.

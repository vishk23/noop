// MARK: - Reorderable Today sections (#today-layout)
//
// The liquid Today's sections — the Charge/Effort/Rest hero, the Start-session entry, Synthesis, Key
// Metrics, Workouts, Heart Rate, Recovery Vitals, Your Cards — rendered in one fixed order. This lets the
// user REORDER or HIDE them, with the default being the original order so nothing changes for anyone who
// never customizes Today. Display-only — no metric is computed or stored differently; this only decides
// which already-built sections render and in what sequence.
//
// Stored as a single comma-joined string of section keys in @AppStorage("today.sectionOrder"), the same
// mechanism KeyMetricPrefs uses. The Android side mirrors this byte-identically in TodayLayoutPrefs.kt
// (SharedPreferences "today.sectionOrder"). Every known section stays in the ORDER registry: unknown tokens
// are dropped, and any known section missing from the saved order is INSERTED at its default-order position
// relative to the saved sections — so a section added in a later version surfaces where users expect it
// rather than teleporting to the bottom of an existing saved order.
//
// User visibility is stored separately in "today.hiddenSections". Keeping order and visibility separate is
// intentional: hiding is reversible, a hidden section keeps its stable identity, and a section introduced by
// a future version defaults to visible because it is absent from the explicit hidden set.

/// One reorderable Today section. The rawValue is the stable persisted identifier — keep it byte-identical
/// to the Android `TodaySection` enum so a backup/restore reads the same layout on either OS.

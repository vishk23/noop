/**
 * #909 — every continuously-animating surface must consult [rememberPoseStill], so battery saver and
 * "Remove animations" both collapse it to its single posed frame.
 *
 * The Apple measurement behind this: an idle Today screen costs ~18% of a CPU core with the live gauges
 * running and 0.0% posed still, the same in Debug and Release because the per-frame work is canvas
 * drawing rather than arithmetic. A frame loop that forgets the gate keeps burning that in battery saver,
 * and nothing about the screen looks wrong — which is exactly why it needs a test rather than review.
 *
 * The census is `withFrameNanos` and `rememberInfiniteTransition`, the two ways this app runs an
 * unbounded frame loop. A file containing either must also read the gate. That is coarser than checking
 * each call site's control flow, deliberately: it cannot be fooled by a loop that is gated in a helper,
 * and it fails loudly the moment a NEW animating file appears ungated, which is the case worth catching.
 *
 * One-shot animations are out of scope on purpose. `CountUpText`, `staggeredAppear` and the 160 ms
 * `liquidPress` tween settle and stop, so they are not the cost battery saver is asking to avoid, and the
 * Apple change this mirrors gated only its `TimelineView`s. They keep asking `rememberReduceMotion` alone.
 *
 * Fails rather than skips when it cannot find the source, for the reason
 * [com.noop.data.HrFrontierQueryShapeTest] documents: a guard whose absence reads as a pass is not a guard.

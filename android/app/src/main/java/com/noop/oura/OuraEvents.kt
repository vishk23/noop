// OuraEvents: the decoded value structs the driver emits (OURA_PROTOCOL.md s6). Kotlin twin of
// OuraEvents.swift. Each carries the record's ringTimestamp (the ring-clock value; the app anchors it
// to UTC via the 0x42 time-sync / 0x85 RTC events) plus the decoded signal. Pure value types, no
// android.bluetooth.
//
// DIVERGENCE FROM SWIFT: Swift's UInt32 ringTimestamp becomes a Long holding the unsigned 32-bit
// value (0..0xFFFFFFFF), and Swift's Int64 epoch becomes Long. Values and layouts are identical.
//
// Per-sample timestamps inside a record (IBI/temp/HRV/SpO2) walk backward from the event time by each
// sample's own duration (OURA_PROTOCOL.md s6); to stay platform-pure and avoid baking a clock model
// into the decoders, the structs carry the raw ring/sample offsets and let the app's mapping layer
// apply the anchor. Honest-data invariant: a short/malformed record decodes to null upstream, so
// these structs only ever hold real decoded values.

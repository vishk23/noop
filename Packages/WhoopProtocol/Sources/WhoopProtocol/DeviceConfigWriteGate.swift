/// #891 / #103: the ONE device-config key this app may write beyond the Broadcast-HR flag —
/// `enable_raw_data_w_ecg` — and the key-aware allowlist that keeps every other key off the wire.
///
/// ## Where the key came from
///
/// The strap listed it itself. `START_DEVICE_CONFIG_KEY_EXCHANGE(115)` + `SEND_NEXT_DEVICE_CONFIG(116)`
/// — the read-only enumeration pair `ConfigKeySweep` builds — was answered by a WHOOP 5 MG with
/// `revision=1 count=7`, and the walk ran to a clean `index=255 validKey=false` terminator listing:
///
/// ```
/// sigproc_wear_detect            enable_rfid                    max_collection_backlog
/// cont_collection_mode           whoop_live_hr_in_adv_ind_pkt   whoop_live_2_hrm_devices
/// enable_raw_data_w_ecg
/// ```
///
/// Six of those seven were unknown to this codebase. Nothing here is guessed: the names are the strap's
/// own, read off its own enumeration.
///
/// ## Why this key, and why now
///
/// #891 records that all three TOGGLE_LABRADOR (ECG) commands — 139, 125, 124 — answer `SUCCESS(1)` on a
/// WHOOP 5 MG and produce **zero** ECG packets in a 30-second listen. What the echoed byte those replies
/// carry actually MEANS is still open: arg-echo is refuted (SELECT_WRIST was sent 0 and answered 1) and
/// blanket payload-echo is refuted (GET_BATTERY_LEVEL sends `[0x00]` and answers 0x2F), but "read-back of
/// stored state" remains an inference — a per-opcode handler echoing a constant fits every observation so
/// far just as well. Either way the practical lesson holds: a `SUCCESS` result byte is not evidence that
/// state changed.
///
/// On the same strap `enable_raw_data_w_ecg` reads `'0'`. A device-config key whose name pairs "raw data"
/// with "ecg", sitting at `'0'` on a strap whose ECG toggles accept and emit nothing, is the leading
/// candidate for the gate. **Whether flipping it actually produces ECG data is UNKNOWN.** A negative
/// result — gate flipped to `'1'`, read back as `'1'`, still no packets — is a publishable answer that
/// removes the leading hypothesis from #891, and is the outcome this path is built to establish either way.
///
/// ## Why a write is safe to offer at all
///
/// Config writes on this firmware are demonstrated, not assumed: running the existing `enable_r22_*`
/// sequence (#174) moved `enable_sig12` from `'2'` (0x32) to `'1'` (0x31), confirmed by a 121 read before
/// and after. So a `SET_DEVICE_CONFIG_VALUE(119)` write lands, and the value that comes back afterwards is
/// real rather than an echo of what was sent.
///
/// ## Read-back is the proof, not the ack
///
/// The write's own `COMMAND_RESPONSE` is **not** treated as evidence. #891 is the standing example of why:
/// `SELECT_WRIST` returns SUCCESS for a no-op and FAILURE for a real change, so a result byte says nothing
/// reliable about whether state moved. Every write from this path is therefore followed by a
/// `GET_DEVICE_CONFIG_VALUE(121)` read of the same key, and only the value that comes back is reported.
/// (Framing owed to @ryanbr on #891.)
///
/// ## The allowlist is key-aware, not just opcode-aware
///
/// Opcode 119 is shared: the Broadcast-HR flag (#181) writes through it too. An opcode-only allowlist
/// therefore cannot express "this key and no other", and before this file the 5/MG send path admitted ANY
/// device-config key while the Broadcast-HR opt-in happened to be on. `admitsSend` closes that: it parses
/// the key name out of the body and admits exactly two keys, each only while its OWN opt-in is on. The
/// five remaining enumerated keys are named in `outOfScopeKeys` and are refused unconditionally — their
/// effects are unknown and nothing here has any reason to move them.
///
/// This is the same discipline `DeviceConfigReadProbe.isReadOnlyOpcode` established for the read probes: a
/// single pure predicate that the BLE send path itself consults, so a unit test proving the predicate
/// rejects something is proving it about the real wire path and not about a parallel copy of the rule.
///

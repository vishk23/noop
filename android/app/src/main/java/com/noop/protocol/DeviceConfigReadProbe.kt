/**
 * #103: READ-ONLY probe of the two config **read** verbs — `GET_DEVICE_CONFIG_VALUE` (121 / 0x79) and
 * `GET_FF_VALUE` (128 / 0x80). Kotlin twin of Swift `DeviceConfigReadProbe` /
 * `DeviceConfigReadProbeReport` (`Packages/WhoopProtocol/…/DeviceConfigReadProbe.swift`); the decoded
 * fields, the plan the probe walks and the rendered report text are byte-identical across platforms, so
 * a strap log reads the same either side.
 *
 * Follow-up to the #761 enumeration probe, which asked the strap for key NAMES; this asks for a key's
 * VALUE.
 *
 * ## Why
 *
 * NOOP writes config two ways and reads it neither way. `SET_FF_VALUE` (120 / 0x78) writes the sixteen
 * R22 feature flags in [Whoop5Config.enableR22Sequence]; `SET_DEVICE_CONFIG_VALUE` (119 / 0x77) writes
 * the one device-config key NOOP knows (the Broadcast-HR flag, #181). Those are two *different
 * namespaces* sharing a body layout — and the 117/118 enumerate pair #761 built covers the feature-flag
 * namespace ONLY. The device-config namespace has never been read or enumerated here at all.
 *
 * That matters for #103. NOOP already decodes a byte the deep record carries at offset 82 that reads as
 * real SpO2 on some straps and is flat 0x00 on others, which is what a subscription gate would look
 * like. If a config value governs it, it is far more likely to live in the device-config namespace than
 * among the sixteen flags NOOP already writes — and nobody has ever asked a strap for one.
 *
 * ## What this establishes, and the honest failure case
 *
 * Both read verbs answered on a real WHOOP 5 MG (WS50_r03), and the reply turned out to be an
 * **existence oracle**: `SUCCESS(1)` for a key name the firmware has, `FAILURE(0)` for one it does not.
 * That is what makes a key-name search possible at all, and [ConfigKeySweep] is where it lives.
 *
 * The probe now runs a plan built around one principle: **ask the strap before guessing.** It opens with
 * the DEVICE-CONFIG ENUMERATION pair `START_DEVICE_CONFIG_KEY_EXCHANGE` (115) and
 * `SEND_NEXT_DEVICE_CONFIG` (116) — named in the repo's own `CommandNumber` table, never sent by anything
 * here, and the structural twin of the 117/118 feature-flag pair #872 shipped and a strap answered. If
 * 115/116 answer, the strap lists its own device-config keys and no name needs guessing at all; the
 * candidate sweep is skipped and the report says so. A clean "115/116 are not served" is equally useful
 * and publishable — it is what promotes the guessing fallback from a shortcut to the only available
 * method.
 *
 * After enumeration the probe reads the values of keys already known to exist (the sixteen in
 * [Whoop5Config.enableR22Sequence], plus anything enumeration returned), spends two round-trips
 * establishing whether the two namespaces are actually separate, and only then — and only when
 * enumeration produced nothing — asks the guessed names in [ConfigKeySweep.CATALOGUE].
 *
 * ## Read-only by construction
 *
 * The probe writes command frames purely in order to read, the same shape as the Oura feature-status
 * probes NOOP already ships and as the #761 enumeration. The SET verbs are named in [WRITE_OPCODES] for
 * exactly one reason: so the send allowlist can be expressed as "[READ_ONLY_OPCODES] only" and a unit
 * test can prove 119/120 are rejected by it. Nothing in this file or on its BLE path can form a SET
 * frame.
 *
 * ## Wire shape (a documented guess, and it fails closed)
 *
 * Request: command 121 or 128 with body `[0x01]` — the inner b3 convention CLIENT_HELLO and the
 * SET_CONFIG family use — followed by the key name as ASCII NUL-padded to 32 bytes, the same name field
 * [Whoop5Config.payloadBody] / [Whoop5Config.deviceConfigBody] build for the SET side, minus the
 * trailing value byte a read has no reason to carry. That body shape is inferred from the SET side, not
 * observed; if it is wrong the strap answers FAILURE or nothing, which the report says plainly.
 *
 * Response: an ordinary COMMAND_RESPONSE echoing the command byte, whose record sits behind the 2-byte
 * response header (`pay[1]` is the 5/MG result code) — the same offset every other COMMAND_RESPONSE
 * decoder here uses. Beyond that offset **no field layout is assumed**: the record is kept and reported
 * as raw hex. A value is only ever *claimed* when the reply echoes the key that was asked for inside a
 * 32-byte NUL-padded name field, in which case the byte immediately after that field is reported as the
 * value — the SET side's own layout, checked rather than assumed.
 *
 * Everything fails closed: a frame whose CRCs don't verify, whose type is not COMMAND_RESPONSE, or whose
 * record is too short is REJECTED rather than guessed at.

// Whoop5Variant.swift — WHOOP MG vs plain WHOOP 5.0 hardware discrimination (#520).
//
// DELIBERATELY ORTHOGONAL to `DeviceFamily`. `DeviceFamily.whoop5` describes the WIRE PROTOCOL
// (CRC16-Modbus header, puffin packet types) and MG and 5.0 are byte-identical there — every
// framing/interpreter switch must keep treating them as one family. This type describes the
// HARDWARE instead: an MG carries the ECG-conductive clasp, a 5.0 does not. Keeping the two apart
// means a capability gate (ECG, and later BP) can never accidentally change how a frame is parsed.
//
// Pure: no CoreBluetooth, no I/O. The app layer supplies the two strings (see below) and this
// decides. The Kotlin twin is com.noop.protocol.Whoop5Variant — keep them byte-identical.
//
// Provenance: the serial prefixes and the 5.0 hardware-revision string are protocol FACTS
// (uncopyrightable), corroborated by community reverse-engineering discussed in #520. They are
// read from the standard BLE Device Information Service, not from any WHOOP code.

/// Which WHOOP 5-generation hardware a connection is talking to.
///
/// `DeviceFamily.whoop5` still governs all framing/decode; this only gates hardware capability.

    ///  1. Both signals present and CONTRADICTORY (hw says 5.0, serial says MG) → `.unknown`.
    ///     We refuse to pick a winner: only the 5.0 hardware string is attested today, so a
    ///     contradiction means our model is incomplete, not that one source is authoritative.
    ///     Mis-stamping hardware is exactly what #716 cost us — an honest "unknown" is cheaper.
    ///  2. Hardware revision carrying the known 5.0 token → `.fiveZero` (device-attested).
    ///  3. Serial prefix → `.mg` / `.fiveZero`.
    ///  4. Anything else → `.unknown`. Never infer from a digit elsewhere in the name (#772).

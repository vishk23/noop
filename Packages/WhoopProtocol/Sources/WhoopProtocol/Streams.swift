/// `@72`, "degC computed server-side" per the schema) but a CENTIDEGREE register on the 5/MG (v18
/// `@73`). A single family-blind `raw/100` sent every 4.0 night ~8 °C low, below the 28 °C worn gate,
/// so skin temp and the illness signal vanished (issue #938, reporter dpguglielmi's 4.0 capture).
///
/// - `.whoop5`: `raw / 100`. PROVEN on real 5/MG captures — `Whoop5HistoricalTests` reads worn 3057 =
///   30.6 °C and off-wrist 2247 = 22.5 °C, physically right on both ends. Unchanged.
///
/// - `.whoop4`: a single-anchor affine map. The 4.0 firmware (41.17.6.0) banks byte-72 at 1 Hz
///   ON-WRIST ONLY, so there is ONE solid anchor and NO clean off-wrist room anchor from the strap.
///   The reporter's doff/don capture gives a steady worn resting value of raw ~826 (worn steady
///   ~830–865; a no-contact floor ~510–520 at removal, then banking stops). Under `/100` that worn
///   value reads ~8.3 °C — impossible for a wrist streaming a resting HR (~52 bpm). We anchor the
///   worn value at a defensible nocturnal wrist skin temperature (33.0 °C ↔ the worn anchor raw) and
///   carry a PROVISIONAL slope until a second calibration point exists. Because the downstream use is a
///   deviation from the user's OWN nightly baseline (`skinTempDevC`), the offset is what must be right
///   to clear the absolute 28–42 °C worn gate + 20–42 °C baseline clamp; a slope error only rescales
///   the deviation and stays directionally correct. All 4.0 values APPROXIMATE.
///
///   PER-DEVICE ANCHOR (#938 second capture): `anchorRaw` is the raw that maps to 33.0 °C. It defaults to
///   the global `Whoop4SkinTemp.anchorRaw` (826, first reporter's strap) so every existing caller is
///   byte-identical, but the register OFFSET is per-device — a second real 4.0 strap shows the SAME floor
///   (~509) and saturation (2047) yet a worn band of ~1100–1600 (nightly mean raw ~1290), which the global
///   826 anchor maps to 47–72 °C (all samples fail the worn gate). The analytics caller therefore learns
///   `anchorRaw` from the device's OWN worn median (`Whoop4SkinTemp.deviceAnchorRaw`) so the worn band lands
///   in range; the constant offset cancels in the deviation-from-own-baseline the app consumes.
///
///   TODO(#938): replace the provisional slope with the exact two-point anchor once a second worn

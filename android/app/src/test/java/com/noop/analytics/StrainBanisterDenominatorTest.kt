/**
 * #1545: Banister TRIMP needs its OWN log-map denominator, and the reason is easy to get wrong.
 *
 * [StrainScorer.strainDenominator] (7201) is derived from *Edwards'* daily ceiling — top zone weight 5
 * sustained for 24 h = 7200 — so ln(7201)/ln(7201) = 1 puts a theoretical maximum day at exactly 100.
 * Banister accumulates on a completely different scale, and its ceiling is SEX-DEPENDENT because the
 * exponent differs. Reusing 7201 would quietly score every Banister day against a ceiling it cannot reach.
 *
 * Byte-parity twin of Swift `StrainBanisterDenominatorTests`.

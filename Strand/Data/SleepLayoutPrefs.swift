// MARK: - Reorderable Sleep sections (#sleep-layout)
//
// The Sleep tab's analytical cards — Sleep marks, the Stages hypnogram, Naps, Night detail, the Sleep-debt
// ledger, Stages-vs-typical, and the Asleep-duration trend — render in one fixed order below the pinned
// Sleep-performance hero + date navigator. This lets the user REORDER or HIDE those cards, mirroring the
// Today tab's Arrange sheet (see `TodayLayoutPrefs`), with the default being the original order so nothing
// changes for anyone who never customises Sleep. Display-only — no metric is computed or stored
// differently; this only decides which already-built cards render and in what sequence.
//
// Stored as a single comma-joined string of section keys in @AppStorage("sleep.sectionOrder"), the same
// mechanism `TodayLayoutPrefs`/`KeyMetricPrefs` use. The Android side mirrors this byte-identically in
// SleepLayoutPrefs.kt (SharedPreferences "sleep.sectionOrder"). Every known section stays in the ORDER
// registry: unknown tokens are dropped, and any known section missing from the saved order is INSERTED at
// its default-order position relative to the saved sections — so a card added in a later version surfaces
// where users expect it rather than teleporting to the bottom of an existing saved order.
//
// User visibility is stored separately in "sleep.hiddenSections". Keeping order and visibility separate is
// intentional: hiding is reversible, a hidden card keeps its stable identity, and a card introduced by a
// future version defaults to visible because it is absent from the explicit hidden set.
//
// The Sleep-performance hero and the date navigator are NOT reorderable — they are the fixed frame of the
// tab, exactly as the Today hero is pinned above its arrangeable sections.

/// One reorderable Sleep card. The rawValue is the stable persisted identifier — keep it byte-identical to
/// the Android `SleepSection` enum so a backup/restore reads the same layout on either OS.

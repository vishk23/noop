/**
 * Durable v26 optical-PPG waveform persistence (issue #156 follow-up, PR #415 Android twin). Until now
 * [extractHistoricalStreams] accumulated a v26 record's waveform ONLY to derive a per-second HR estimate
 * (`ppgHr`); the raw samples were discarded once that estimate was taken. This proves the raw waveform now
 * survives as its OWN stream ([com.noop.data.StreamBatch.ppgWaveform]), independently of whether the HR
 * estimator had enough context to run.
 *
 * The fixture is the SAME real captured v26 frame the Swift `Whoop5PpgWaveformTests` uses (a clean PPG
 * upstroke, all-negative AC-coupled ADC counts), so the decoded waveform is cross-platform ground truth.

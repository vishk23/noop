// MARK: - NavRouter
//
// A tiny shared navigation hook so a screen can ask the app shell to switch to another top-level
// destination without knowing how that shell is built. The two shells navigate very differently —
// macOS drives a `NavigationSplitView` sidebar selection (`RootView`), iOS uses a `TabView` whose
// "everything else" screens live behind the More tab (`RootTabView`) — so neither exposes a shared
// `selection` binding LiveView could reach. This object is the small, shared bridge between them.
//
// Usage: a screen calls `router.openDevices()`; the shell observes `requestedDestination` and routes
// itself (macOS sets the sidebar selection to `.devices`; iOS presents `DevicesView`). Each consumer
// clears the request once it's handled so the same tap can fire again later. Injected at both app
// roots (`StrandApp`, `StrandiOSApp`) as an `@EnvironmentObject`.

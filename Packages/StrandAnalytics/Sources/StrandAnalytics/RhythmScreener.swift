// RhythmScreener.swift — beat-to-beat regularity DESCRIPTIVE statistics + Poincaré
// point cloud for an experimental, non-clinical wellness VISUALIZATION.
//
// Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-19-v5-rhythm-screening-design.md (§3, §11).
//
// SCOPE OF THIS ENGINE (deliberately narrow — read §11 of the spec):
//   This builds ONLY the pure regularity math and a NEUTRAL categorical label scoped
//   to a visualization ("looked steady" / "some variation" / "varied a lot" /
//   "couldn't read"). It deliberately does NOT emit any "consider a clinician" verdict,
//   any condition name, any probability-of-condition number, or any alarm. That
//   screening verdict is HELD per the spec's §11 recommendation and is gated behind a
//   separate go/no-go + the consent machinery — it is not part of this code.
//
// WHAT IT COMPUTES, over a clean RESTING window of successive R-R intervals
// (range-filtered, but NOT ectopic-stripped — we need the ectopy):
//   • Poincaré scatter SD1 / SD2 / SD1:SD2 ratio. SD1 = RMSSD/√2 (the standard rotated
//     short-axis SD of the (NN[i], NN[i+1]) cloud), SD2 = sqrt(2·SDNN² − SD1²) (the
//     long axis). A steady rhythm gives a tight elongated comet (small SD1, low ratio);
//     a more variable rhythm gives a rounder, more diffuse cloud (ratio → 1).
//   • Normalised RMSSD (RMSSD / meanNN) — a scale-free beat-to-beat variation index.
//   • Turning-point rate — the fraction of interior ΔNN sign changes (local extrema):
//     smooth respiratory modulation gives a low rate; disorganised beat-to-beat
//     direction flips give a high one. Compared against the value EXPECTED for a random
//     series (2/3), normalised to [0, ~1.5].
//   • Ectopic-beat fraction — `HRVAnalyzer.rejectEctopic` run as a COUNTER: the fraction
//     of beats the Malik filter WOULD drop. HRV throws these away; here we count them.
//   • The Poincaré point cloud itself (paired successive intervals) for the plot.
//
// All statistics are deterministic and reuse HRVAnalyzer's published primitives
// (rmssdRaw / sdnnRaw / rangeFilter / rejectEctopic / median). No new science, no model.
//
// NON-CLINICAL: every label is descriptive and benign. There are no disease names,
// no diagnostic claims, and no call-to-action anywhere in this file.

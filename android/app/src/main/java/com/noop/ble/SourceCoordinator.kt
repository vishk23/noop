/**
 * Runs exactly ONE device's live BLE at a time, driven by [DeviceRegistry]'s active device id.
 *
 * Faithful Kotlin twin of Strand/BLE/SourceCoordinator.swift.
 *
 * WHOOP-FIRST, ZERO REGRESSION
 * ----------------------------
 * This coordinator is a deliberate NO-OP whenever the active device is the WHOOP (id "my-whoop", any
 * `brand == "WHOOP"` row, OR an unknown id). That is the default state and EVERY state where no generic
 * strap is paired: WHOOP is active, the coordinator does nothing, and the existing WHOOP flow
 * ([WhoopBleClient.connect] via [AppViewModel.connect]) runs exactly as it does today. It only ever
 * *acts* when the active device is a NON-WHOOP generic HR strap:
 *
 *   • switching TO a generic strap → [stopWhoop] (WHOOP's existing disconnect), then start the isolated
 *     [StandardHrSource] for that strap's deviceId.
 *   • switching BACK to WHOOP     → stop the [StandardHrSource], then [startWhoop] (WHOOP's existing scan
 *     entry) — but only if we had actually been on a strap, so a plain launch with WHOOP active does NOT
 *     re-trigger a redundant WHOOP scan.
 *
 * It never imports or references [WhoopBleClient] internals: the WHOOP start/stop are injected closures
 * from the composition root, so the two BLE flows stay fully decoupled (mirrors [StandardHrSource]'s
 * isolation). Live HR from a strap is pushed through [liveSink]; the app wires that to the SAME live
 * state the UI observes (e.g. `ble::publishExternalLiveHr`).
 *
 * On Android the registry exposes the active id as a one-shot suspend read (not a published flow like
 * Swift's `@Published activeDeviceId`), so the app calls [onActiveDeviceChanged] after any registry
 * mutation that can change the active device (the Devices screen's setActive — the next task), and
 * [start] reconciles once against the current active id at launch (a no-op for a single-WHOOP install).

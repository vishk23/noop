/*
 * StressOnsetDetector.kt — the L3 closed-loop JITAI ("just-in-time adaptive intervention") detector.
 * Generalises the math currently inline in AppModel.evaluateStress() into an EDGE-triggered, motion-gated,
 * REPLAY-SAFE detector that decides — at the moment it matters — whether to offer a 60-s guided breathing
 * cue. PURE + DB-free, carrying its OWN de-dup state exactly like [SedentaryDetector.evaluate]: the caller
 * persists [Decision.nextState] and feeds it back, so a replayed window can't re-fire. No I/O / BLE here.
 *
 * Faithful Kotlin mirror of StrandAnalytics/StressOnsetDetector.swift — keep the EMA baseline, the drop
 * threshold, the edge trigger, the exercise gate, and the rate-limit/quiet-hours suppressors byte-identical
 * to Swift (cross-platform parity is the contract, pinned by matching golden-vector tests).
 * See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-19-v5-haptic-biofeedback-design.md (L3).
 *
 * WHAT IT GENERALISES (from AppModel.evaluateStress): a rolling clean-R-R buffer → a SLOW RMSSD baseline
 * (the shipped 0.98/0.02 EMA) + a resting-HR band gate (55–100 bpm) + a `rmssd < baseline × 0.6` drop +
 * a once-per-15-min limiter + a single confirming buzz. What this engine ADDS, per spec:
 *   1. A FAST short-window RMSSD (the latest beats) vs the slow baseline.
 *   2. EDGE trigger: fire ONCE on the fresh crossing (was-above → now-below), not every tick.
 *   3. The EXERCISE GATE (the credibility line): suppress when HR is out of the resting band AND/OR recent
 *      motion says "metabolic, not stress". A brisk walk's HRV dip must NOT fire a "you're stressed" cue.
 *   4. Rate-limit + quiet hours + master toggle, and never while a manual Breathe/L1/L2 session runs.
 *
 * HONEST / NON-CLINICAL: "stress" is an autonomic PROXY (HRV-down vs the user's OWN baseline), never a
 * diagnosis. The card the caller shows says "HRV dipped while you were still" — never "you are stressed".
 * On fire: a single confirming buzz + a passive in-app card; NEVER a push notification unless the user
 * opted into notifications (matches DaytimeStress's "passive suggestion, never a notification" stance).
 *
 * All `ts`/`nowSec` are wall-clock unix SECONDS. Outputs are APPROXIMATE, not medical advice.

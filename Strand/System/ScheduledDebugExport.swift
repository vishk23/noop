/// The DAILY scheduled debug auto-export (#510 — maddognik) for Apple, in PARITY with Android's
/// `DebugExportScheduler`.
///
/// At the user's chosen time-of-day this writes the durable strap-log tail ([LiveState.scheduledExportText])
/// — and, when a raw 5/MG capture exists, copies that alongside — to the app's Documents directory under a
/// `yyMMdd-HHmm` timestamped filename, once per day, with no UI. It exists so a reporter chasing an
/// intermittent overnight fault gets a dated log waiting each morning instead of having to remember to hit
/// "Save strap log" at the right moment.
///
/// HONEST about platform limits (the whole point of doing this carefully on Apple):
/// - **macOS** — the app is usually running, so a foreground `DispatchSourceTimer` fires reliably at the
///   chosen minute, and `catchUpIfDue()` covers the case where the time passed while the app wasn't open.
///   This path is dependable.
/// - **iOS** — a sideloaded, backgrounded app can't guarantee a drop to the exact minute. We submit a
///   `BGAppRefreshTaskRequest` for *no earlier than* the chosen time and write when iOS next wakes us near
///   it. The Settings copy says exactly that — we never promise an exact background drop. (The app entry
///   point registers the handler id below via `register(perform:)`; if it isn't registered/permitted yet,
///   `submit` fails gracefully and the in-app "Run now" + the macOS path still work.)
///
/// Opt-in, default OFF — like every NOOP automation. Everything is on-device; nothing is sent anywhere.
///
/// RETENTION (#650): every write is pruned to `keepCount` generations (default 14), oldest first, and
/// the Test Centre export card offers a manual "Clear scheduled exports" for an immediate wipe — these
/// files sit in Documents (Files-visible) with no UI in the loop reminding anyone they exist, so a
/// default cap and a visible clear action both matter. Mirrors Android's `LogExport` retention.

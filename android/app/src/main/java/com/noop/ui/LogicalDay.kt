/**
 * The "logical day" key the dashboard treats as Today.
 *
 * A naive `LocalDate.now()` rolls the moment the clock passes midnight, so between 00:00 and the
 * morning the dashboard would look up a brand-new calendar day that has no banked row yet and blank
 * out — even though the user is still in the same wear/sleep cycle as the previous evening (#144).
 *
 * The logical day rolls at [rolloverHour] (04:00 LOCAL) instead: it is the calendar date of
 * `now - rolloverHour hours`, so the small hours after midnight still resolve to the PRIOR calendar
 * date's row. This is a PRESENTATION-layer remap only — used purely to pick which stored row is
 * "Today" and to anchor the Today HR-trend window. Stored row keys are never rewritten (they stay
 * keyed on their own true calendar date), so the blast radius is deliberately tiny. An explicit
 * date label stays visible under the header so the remap is always honest.
 *
 * Pure + injectable so [LogicalDayTest] can pin the boundaries:
 *  - 23:59 → same calendar day (still the evening's logical day)
 *  - 01:00 → previous calendar day (the night still belongs to yesterday)
 *  - 04:01 → the new calendar day (a fresh logical day has begun)

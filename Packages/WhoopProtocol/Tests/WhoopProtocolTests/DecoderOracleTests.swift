/// `Resources/decoder_oracle.json` is a fixture of REAL captured WHOOP type-47 HISTORICAL_DATA frames
/// plus their expected decode. The IDENTICAL file is committed at
/// `android/app/src/test/resources/decoder_oracle.json`, and `DecoderOracleTest.kt` runs the same
/// assertions through the Kotlin `decodeHistorical`. Because both decoders are independent
/// reimplementations of the same byte layout, decoding the same fixture and asserting the same output
/// is what catches a one-sided edit (a moved offset / changed scaling on one platform only).
///
/// The fixture was seeded from existing in-repo test vectors (Whoop4HistoricalV24HardwareTests,
/// Whoop4HistoricalV25Tests, Whoop5HistoricalTests and their Kotlin twins), so every expected value is
/// already independently grounded , this test only proves the two decoders agree on it.
///
/// The oracle pins THREE layers, each with a twin test in `DecoderOracleTest.kt` (#647, #775):
///  1. `frames`         , decoded VALUES. A per-platform fixture-hex test cannot catch a 32-vs-64-bit
///                        or signedness divergence: the wire bytes are identical on both platforms and
///                        each suite asserts its own answer. Comparing the decoded NUMBERS against one
///                        shared expectation is what catches it (PR #848: a u32 with bit 31 set read
///                        3232194973 on Swift and -1062772323 on Kotlin).
///  2. `stream_batches` , the ASSEMBLED shape. Frame decode agreeing does not imply assembly agrees ,
///                        PR #848 also shipped a Kotlin `StreamBatch.isEmpty` that omitted a stream
///                        Swift's `Streams.isEmpty` included, and `insert` early-returns on empty, so
///                        that batch banked nothing on Android alone.
///  3. `coverage`       , the self-defence manifest, so the oracle cannot silently stop covering
///                        something. Deleting an `expect` key, a frame or a batch fails a test.

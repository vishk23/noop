 * Device-registry façade over [WhoopDao] + [WhoopDatabase] — the Android port of the Swift
 * `DeviceRegistryStore` (Packages/WhoopStore). Owns the device list, the single-active invariant, and
 * the day-ownership override table.
 *
 * Invariant I1 (at most one `active` device) is enforced in [setActive]: the demote+promote pair runs
 * inside one transaction, so a crash mid-swap can never leave two active rows (or none).
 *
 * The transaction boundary is injected as [transactor] (defaulting to Room's `db.withTransaction`) so
 * the registry's logic is exercisable on the plain JVM without a real Room database — mirroring how the
 * rest of the test suite stays Robolectric-free (see DeviceRegistryTest / MoodStoreTest).

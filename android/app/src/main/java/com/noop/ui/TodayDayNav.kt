// MARK: - Day navigation (#817) - chevron arrows + horizontal swipe, iOS parity
//
// `selectedDayOffset` is days-back-from-today (0 = today, 1 = yesterday, ...). The header chevrons and a
// horizontal swipe across the dashboard both move it: older increments the offset (no upper bound - you
// can browse arbitrarily far back), newer decrements it but is CLAMPED at 0 so a future day can never be
// selected. These pure helpers hold that clamp so it's covered by a JVM test and shared by both the
// arrow taps and the swipe handler, matching the iOS DayNavBar's `canGoNewer` / `selectedOffset +/- 1`.

/**
 * #860 item 1: the launch day-landing policy, as ONE pure decision so the rule can't drift between the
 * screen and its test and stays byte-identical to the iOS `TodayView.launchDayOffset` twin. A FRESH-PROCESS
 * launch ALWAYS lands on today (offset 0), even when today has no data yet and the only banked data is N days
 * back - that exact case is what stranded a calibrating user on an old day after an app update (the reporter's
 * case on v7.6.0). A non-fresh (in-session) call returns [savedOffset] UNCHANGED, so tabbing away to an old
 * day and coming back within the same process preserves the user-navigated day (#739/#614). [hasTodayData]
 * and [latestDataDayBack] are accepted so the signature documents the inputs the retired auto-land consumed,
 * but on a fresh launch they intentionally have NO effect - the old "land on the most recent data day"
 * behaviour (#605/#739) is retired. Mirror EXACTLY in Swift.

/**
 * #1303: find a WHOOP 5/MG strap serial inside the GET_HELLO (145) info block.
 *
 * A stable per-strap id is the keystone the multi-strap work waits on, and today there is no strap
 * serial decoded anywhere: [BatteryPackInfo]'s serial is the BATTERY PACK's, read via cmd 151 and
 * answered only by a 5/MG, so it identifies a removable part rather than the strap wearing it.
 *
 * The 4.0 hunt has a capture aid already (the `GET_HELLO_HARVARD` (35) raw dump). This is the 5/MG
 * half, and it needs no new traffic: the GET_HELLO block is ALREADY decoded — for the device name at
 * `pay[16]` and the firmware version at `pay[93]` — and everything else in it is simply discarded. If
 * the serial is in there, it is arriving on every connect and being thrown away.
 *
 * ## Why this reports structure instead of dumping the block
 *
 * The same response carries a SESSION TOKEN, which the decoder deliberately never reads. Dumping the
 * payload wholesale would put that token in a log, so this reports every printable run as
 * offset + length + class and prints the CONTENTS only of runs that could plausibly be the serial and
 * are not the already-known name: fully alphanumeric, [SERIAL_LEN_MIN]..[SERIAL_LEN_MAX] characters.
 *
 * That rule is a filter, not a guarantee — a token that happened to be alphanumeric and serial-length
 * would print. Which is precisely why the caller gates this behind an opt-in diagnostic rather than
 * the default, shareable strap log.
 *
 * Pure, so it unit-tests with no strap, no BLE and no Android. Byte-identical twin of the Swift
 * `HelloIdentityProbe`.

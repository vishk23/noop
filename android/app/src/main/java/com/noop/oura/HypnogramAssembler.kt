// HypnogramAssembler: reconstruct the TIME AXIS of the ring's sleep-phase hypnogram. Byte-identical
// Kotlin twin of Swift's HypnogramAssembler.swift.
//
// THE PROBLEM (observed on-device 2026-07-12, Gen3): the ring's SleepNet finalizes a night's staging
// AFTER wake and writes the whole hypnogram to its event log in ONE BURST — e.g. 23 records x 52
// codes, all sharing essentially the same envelope ring-time (the WRITE moment). The envelope
// timestamp therefore marks WHEN THE ANALYSIS WAS SAVED, not when the sleep happened; anchoring each
// record at its envelope collapses an entire night onto a few seconds.
//
// THE RECONSTRUCTION: the burst's codes are one contiguous sequence at 30 s/code, ENDING at the
// anchored burst end. Laying N codes backward from that end recovers the real window. The 30 s epoch
// is triple-confirmed: open_oura's sleepnet.md ("DEEP/LIGHT/REM/WAKE classification at 30-second
// intervals"), the observed window math (1,196 codes over a ~10 h night), and the 0x49 summary's
// window minutes over those same codes. The burst end itself is the matching 0x49 window's TRUE
// sleep end when available (the write moment trails it by 10–43 min observed) — that pairing lives
// in the live source; this assembler only groups and lays out.
//
// Platform-pure, no android.bluetooth, no clock (the caller resolves the anchored end time).

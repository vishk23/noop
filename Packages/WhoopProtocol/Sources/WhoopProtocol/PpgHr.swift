/// On v26-heavy stretches of a night the strap records the 24 Hz optical PPG waveform instead of the
/// v18 per-second summary that carries HR. The v26 records are real cardiac signal, so this pure
/// estimator recovers a per-second HR from them via windowed autocorrelation, keeping the biometric
/// timeline continuous through the gaps. It is HR-only — PPG carries NO body motion, so this fills HR
/// continuity, NOT actigraphy and NOT HRV (the contributor confirmed v26 gives no RMSSD).

/// Mirrors `tools/linux-capture/ppg_hr.py` (PR #162, Python side): 8 s autocorrelation window, a
/// 30–220 bpm search band (lags 6…48 at 24 Hz), linear detrend, normalised peak as confidence, and a
/// fundamental-period preference so the harmonic peaks at 2×/3× the true period don't report half/third
/// the real rate. Pure + Foundation-only so it is unit-testable from synthetic and captured waveforms.
